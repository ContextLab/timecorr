recog retrieval fmri confidence analysis

-good discussion of t/l, confidence, brain signals, interpreting correlations

-?left and right hand for response?
-similar relationship between bold signal and condition (h m cr fa) as i found in power analysis
-confidence
  - targets: increasing bold signal with increasing conf in b/l hippo, L ERC
  - foils: decreasing bold with increasing confidence in LTPc and L ERC, but not in either HIPP


The second set of analyses sought to address this ambiguity and found that activity for foils in the anterior parahippocampal gyrus was highest for foils judged as new with high confidence and that activity decreased as a function of confidence (a novelty effect). There was no novelty effect detected for foils in the hippocampus. For targets, activity in both the anterior parahippocampal gyrus and the hippocampus was lowest for targets that were judged to be new (misses), and activity in both these regions increased for hits as a function of increasing recognition confidence (a familiarity effect).

Note that the response in the hippocampus that we observed for targets increased monotonically with recognition confidence. This is not to say that the hippocampus was active for low- confidence decisions relative to misses or relative to baseline. Indeed, when we contrasted hits with confidence 4 or 5 against misses, we did not observe active regions in the hippocampus.


We observed a novelty effect within the anterior parahippocampal gyrus. That is, activity was highest when participants had high confidence that an item was new


When we analyzed activity in relation to old and new stimuli separately, we observed a novelty signal for foils in the anterior parahippocampal gyrus and a familiarity signal for targets in the anterior parahippocampal gyrus and in the hippocampus. These results indicate that activity in the MTL can sometimes reflect the old/new status of the test items rather than a participant's report of which items are old. Accord- ingly, the actual old/new status of stimuli, not just overt behavioral responses, need to be considered when analyzing and interpreting neuroimaging studies of recognition memory.

	Annote = {review evidence that older adults have trouble with free recall, but particularly with non-recency items.

reviews how this finding has been accounted for by assuming that older adults have impaired LTM but not STM.

But suggests that this dual store account of aging fails for several reasons:

1) the usual suspects in impeaching the dual store model: recency effects in situations where STM can't be credibly implicated
2) newer studies have found a uniform age difference across the serial position curve - that is, no sparing of recency

describes the salthouse speed theory - a specific version form a 1980 paper that applies directly to free recall. assumes that rehearsal increases and items strength, but that strength decays with time. There will be a net increase in strength if rehearsals are frequent enough to more than compensate for decay. because older adults are slower, they rehearse less and therefore strengthen items less and therefore recall less. found that manipulating word length had an effect that looked similar to aging. 


gave old and young 20 item lists with externalized rhearasal instructions. 

looking at standard serial position curves, there was a more or less constant age difference across positions.

Plotting by either functional serial position or last rehershal set dramatically reduced primacy for both groups (as in previous studies the last rehearsal set plot still shows a small and steep primacy effect). The age difference remained in the functional positon plot and was marginally significant in the last rehearsal set plot. In both cases the difference seem larger for later postioons/sets.

Looking at the average shift from nominal to functional positions by nominal position both age groups showed the same basic pattern: early list items shifted a lot (i.e., were rehearsed near the end of the list) with the size of the shift declining monotonically across nominal positon. However there was an age effect - older adults made smaller shifts.},

	Abstract = {Visualizing spatial material is a cornerstone of human problem solving, but human visualization capacity is sharply limited. To investigate the sources of this limit, we developed a new task to measure visualization accuracy for verbally-described spatial paths (similar to street directions), and implemented a computational process model to perform it. In this model, developed within the Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational (ACT-R) architecture, visualization capacity is limited by three mechanisms. Two of these (associative interference and decay) are longstanding characteristics of ACT-R's declarative memory. A third (spatial interference) is a new mechanism motivated by spatial proximity effects in our data. We tested the model in two experiments, one with parameter-value fitting, and a replication without further fitting. Correspondence between model and data was close in both experiments, suggesting that the model may be useful for understanding why visualizing new, complex spatial material is so difficult.},

	the effects of the similarity of other words in a list are considered.
	From the dual-processing perspective, process dissociation data on

	Abstract = {A parallel distributed processing model of visual word recognition
	and pronunciation is described. The model consists of sets of orthographic
	and phonological units and an interlevel of hidden units. Weights
	on connections between units were modified during a training phase
	using the back-propagation learning algorithm. The model simulates
	many aspects of human performance, including (a) differences between
	words in terms of processing difficulty, (b) pronunciation of novel
	items, (c) differences between readers in terms of word recognition
	skill, (d) transitions from beginning to skilled reading, and (e)
	differences in performance on lexical decision and naming tasks.
	The model's behavior early in the learning phase corresponds to that
	of children acquiring word recognition skills. Training with a smaller
	number of hidden units produces output characteristic of many dyslexic
	readers. Naming is simulated without pronunciation rules, and lexical
	decisions are simulated without accessing word-level representations.
	The performance of the model is largely determined by three factors:
	the nature of the input, a significant fragment of written English;
	the learning rule, which encodes the implicit structure of the orthography
	in the weights on connections; and the architecture of the system,
	which influences the scope of what can be learned.},

	Annote = {It is well known that multitrial free recall is accompanied by increased

	of presentation is randomized. We compared the relation between learning
	and organization in 30 young and 30 older adults as they learned
	categorized materials to a criterion of 100\% recall. The importance
	of this age manipulation was that it allowed us to examine, using
	two groups that differ significantly in their learning ability, whether
	organization and learning follow the same function. As was expected,
	older adults showed less organization on any given learning trial.
	However, when equated for degree of learning, the older adults showed
	approximately the same level of organization as the young. This finding
	suggests that the organization-learning relation remains invariant
	in the face of significant differences in participants' mnemonic

	Abstract = {At any one moment, many neuronal groups in our brain are active. Microelectrode
	recordings have characterized the activation of single neurons and
	fMRI has unveiled brain-wide activation patterns. Now it is time
	to understand how the many active neuronal groups interact with each
	other and how their communication is flexibly modulated to bring
	about our cognitive dynamics. I hypothesize that neuronal communication
	is mechanistically subserved by neuronal coherence. Activated neuronal
	groups oscillate and thereby undergo rhythmic excitability fluctuations
	that produce temporal windows for communication. Only coherently
	oscillating neuronal groups can interact effectively, because their
	communication windows for input and for output are open at the same
	times. Thus, a flexible pattern of coherence defines a flexible communication
	structure, which subserves our cognitive flexibility.},

@article{VidyEtal10,
	Abstract = {Repetition suppression (RS) relates to a reduced neuronal response
	to a stimulus that is repeated. This phenomenon has been observed
	in the visual ventral stream and other sensory modalities, suggesting
	that it is a common feature of neuronal processing. Whilst a number
	of different models have been suggested to explain the underlying
	neural mechanisms of RS, they are difficult to test due to variety
	in paradigm design and the limited resolution of different measuring
	modalities. This study combined information from different modalities
	using the same paradigm across the same subjects, in an attempt to
	create a clearer link between fMRI, magnetoencephalography (MEG)
	and behaviour data, and thus better understand the underlying mechanism
	of neuronal RS. We used an oriented Gabor patch stimulus separated
	by two possible interstimulus intervals of 200 or 600 ms and two
	possible orientation combinations: the second patch was consistently
	vertical combined with the first patch which was either horizontal
	(DIFF) or vertical (SAME). For the 200 -ms condition only, behavioural
	data showed a statistically significant impairment in subjects' ability
	to discern the direction of tilt at the SAME condition compared to
	the DIFF condition; fMRI showed suppression of the BOLD response,
	and MEG showed suppression of the peak amplitude. A significant correlation
	between the suppressed BOLD and MEG signals confirm the neuronal
	origin of the BOLD suppression effect. Measurements from the 3 modalities
	suggest that neuronal RS in the visual cortex in the current orientation-driven
	paradigm can be best explained by an overall reduction in the size
	of the response of all neurons (fatigue model) or a reduction in
	the number of neurons responding (sharpening model).},

	Abstract = {Perceptual inference is biased by foreknowledge about what is probable
	or possible. How prior expectations are neurally represented during
	visual perception, however, remains unknown. We used functional magnetic
	resonance imaging to measure brain activity in humans judging simple
	visual stimuli. Perceptual decisions were either biased in favor
	of a single alternative (A/ approximately A decisions) or taken without
	bias toward either choice (A/B decisions). Extrastriate and anterior
	temporal lobe regions were more active during A/ approximately A
	than A/B decisions, suggesting multiple representations of prior
	expectations within the visual hierarchy. Forward connectivity was
	increased when expected and observed perception diverged ("prediction
	error" signals), whereas prior expectations fed backward from higher
	to lower regions. Finally, the coincidence between expected and observed
	perception activated orbital prefrontal regions, perhaps reflecting
	the reinforcement of prior expectations. These data support computational
	and quantitative models proposing that a visual percept emerges from
	converging bottom-up and top-down signals.},

	Annote = {This paper studies gamma-band responses from two implanted epileptic
	patients during a simple visual discrimination task. Our main aim
	was to ascertain, in a reliable manner, whether evoked (stimulus-locked)
	and induced (triggered by, but not locked to, stimuli) responses
	are present in intracranial recordings. For this purpose, we introduce
	new methods adapted to detect the presence of gamma responses at
	this level of recording, intermediary between EEG-scalp and unicellular
	responses. The analysis relies on a trial-by-trial time-frequency
	analysis and on the use of surrogate data for statistical testing.
	We report that visual stimulation reliably elicits evoked and induced
	responses in human intracranial recordings. Induced intracranial
	gamma activity is significantly present in short oscillatory bursts
	(a few cycles) following visual stimulation. These responses are
	highly variable from trial to trial, beginning after 200 ms and lasting
	up to 500 ms. In contrast, intracranial-evoked gamma responses concentrate
	around 100 ms latencies corresponding to evoked responses observed
	on the scalp. We discuss our results in relation to scalp gamma response
	in a similar protocol [Tallon-Baudry et al. (1996) J. Neurosci.,
	16, 4240-4249] and draw some conclusions for bridging the gap between
	gamma oscillations observed on the scalp surface and their possible
	cortical sources.},

weakly, but significantly, correlated with those of monkey's decisions. Our
findings suggest a flexible memory system in which neural subpopulations with

	Abstract = {Human behavioral studies show that there is greater sensory/perceptual
	detail associated with true memories than false memories. We therefore
	hypothesized that true recognition of abstract shapes would elicit
	greater visual cortical activation than would false recognition.
	During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), participants
	studied exemplar shapes and later made recognition memory decisions
	(``old'' or ``new'') concerning studied exemplars (old shapes), nonstudied
	lures (related shapes) and new shapes. Within visual processing regions,
	direct contrasts between true recognition (``old'' response to an
	old shape; old-hit) and false recognition (``old'' response to a
	related shape; related-false alarm) revealed preferential true recognition-related
	activity in early visual processing regions (Brodmann area (BA)17,
	BA18). By comparison, both true and false recognition were associated
	with activity in early and late (BA19, BA37) visual processing regions,
	the late regions potentially supporting ``old'' responses, independent
	of accuracy. Further analyses suggested that the differential early
	visual processing activity reflected repetition priming, a type of
	implicit memory. Thus, the sensory signature that distinguishes true
	from false recognition may not be accessible to conscious awareness.},

@article{Fris05,
	Abstract = {This article concerns the nature of evoked brain responses and the
	principles underlying their generation. We start with the premise
	that the sensory brain has evolved to represent or infer the causes
	of changes in its sensory inputs. The problem of inference is well
	formulated in statistical terms. The statistical fundaments of inference
	may therefore afford important constraints on neuronal implementation.
	By formulating the original ideas of Helmholtz on perception, in
	terms of modern-day statistical theories, one arrives at a model
	of perceptual inference and learning that can explain a remarkable
	range of neurobiological facts.It turns out that the problems of
	inferring the causes of sensory input (perceptual inference) and
	learning the relationship between input and cause (perceptual learning)
	can be resolved using exactly the same principle. Specifically, both
	inference and learning rest on minimizing the brain's free energy,
	as defined in statistical physics. Furthermore, inference and learning
	can proceed in a biologically plausible fashion. Cortical responses
	can be seen as the brain's attempt to minimize the free energy induced
	by a stimulus and thereby encode the most likely cause of that stimulus.
	Similarly, learning emerges from changes in synaptic efficacy that
	minimize the free energy, averaged over all stimuli encountered.
	The underlying scheme rests on empirical Bayes and hierarchical models
	of how sensory input is caused. The use of hierarchical models enables
	the brain to construct prior expectations in a dynamic and context-sensitive
	fashion. This scheme provides a principled way to understand many
	aspects of cortical organization and responses. The aim of this article
	is to encompass many apparently unrelated anatomical, physiological
	and psychophysical attributes of the brain within a single theoretical
	perspective. In terms of cortical architectures, the theoretical
	treatment predicts that sensory cortex should be arranged hierarchically,
	that connections should be reciprocal and that forward and backward
	connections should show a functional asymmetry (forward connections
	are driving, whereas backward connections are both driving and modulatory).
	In terms of synaptic physiology, it predicts associative plasticity
	and, for dynamic models, spike-timing-dependent plasticity. In terms
	of electrophysiology, it accounts for classical and extra classical
	receptive field effects and long-latency or endogenous components
	of evoked cortical responses. It predicts the attenuation of responses
	encoding prediction error with perceptual learning and explains many
	phenomena such as repetition suppression, mismatch negativity (MMN)
	and the P300 in electroencephalography. In psychophysical terms,
	it accounts for the behavioural correlates of these physiological
	phenomena, for example, priming and global precedence. The final
	focus of this article is on perceptual learning as measured with
	the MMN and the implications for empirical studies of coupling among
	cortical areas using evoked sensory responses.},

Activated ltm is in for that is relativity accessible but not actually in the protected area of wm, the region of direct access is the ~4 item protected store where currently relevant info is stored, and the focus of attention is a one item focus where the item that is currently manipulated is stored. 

The region of d access can be distinguished from activated ltm by showing that if ss has to remember two lists of items, but only one is declared as active (ie both must be retained, but ss knows that only one is relevant for current mamipulations) then operations on the active list should have RTs independent of the size of the second set. 

The focus can be distinguished from the region of d access by showing that even for the active list, when two successive operations are carried out on different members of the list RTs are longer than when operations are carried out on the same item. Implying that only a single item can fit in the focus, the extra rt being the cost of moving the focus between items in the region of d access. 

Use a two list updating task to test this. 

One list on the top of the screen one on the bottom. A cue deisgnates aone as active and updating operations (adding numbers) are carried out on different elements. 

Data support both predictions. RTs were faster when only one set was active than when both were, suggesting that inscribe sets can be removed from the region of direct access. Plus, the set sizes of the second set only impacted RTs whe it was active, not when it was designated as inactive. 

A second exp found very similar results where items were not actually updated - participants still added numbers to the original, but these were simply entered into the computer and ss had to remember the original, not updated, number. },

	Annote = {Suggest lots of previous work using spectral analyses to examine EEG differences between older and younger adults. 

Some studies have found older adults show a shift toward higher frequencies, but others have found shifts toward lower frequencies.

The suggest that these contradictory findings may be due to changes in the relationship between electrode sites with age, such that some  sites may increase while others increase.

Suggest using factor analysis to get at this issue

Use a vigilance task that requires participants to attend to a stream of 1's and 0's presented either auditory or visually and to press a button for 1's.

Conduct factor analyses on electro site (128) by time sample matrices, for each 5 second epoch in the EEG voltage trace.

Find that older adults have more principal components with Eigen values greater than 1 regardless of task (samples were taken at various times during the 13min vigilance task as well as during eyes open and eyes closed rest periods at the beginning and end) and that they have more electrode sites that do not load onto a factor (factor loading {\&}lt; .7).


Take this to suggest that older adult's eegs are less spatially coherent than younger adults, but indicate that an analysis of coherence would be a good next step.

@article{Verh11,
	Annote = {Takes on the idea that age related changes in cognition are rooted in declines in executive processes.

Points out that practically any cognitive task shows age related declines, therefore the finding that executive tasks are vulnerable to age does not show anything special about them. Rather he says the real question is whether  executive tasks show declines that are larger than one would expect based on declines in non-executive tasks. One way to do this is to make a baseline version of the executive control task that removes the executive component.

also points out that older adults often show proportional rather than additive slowing relative to young adults, so it is not enough to show that the age difference in terms of speed is greater for the executive than the baseline version of a task - that is exactly what would be expected based on a constant proportional slowing that is insensitive to age (e.g., if the baseline is 100 ms for young and old are 1.1 times slower they would be 110ms for a 10ms difference, if the executive component adds 50ms young would be 150ms and older at 1.1 times would be 165ms for a 15ms age difference - so the age difference is greater in the executive version, but not because executive function has a bigger impact on olders, but because slowing is proportional) ME: why would slowing be proportional?


First look at inhibition tasks.

General method is to plot both the baseline and control versions of the task on the same brinley plot. The idea is that if a single slowing function can explain the age difference in both condition, you should be able to fit the points in the brinley plot with a single line. Find that one line does for inhibition of return, arrow flanker, stroop, and negative priming. But that reading with distraction requires two lines.

One question I have is that while one line seems to do in most cases, the slopes differ across tasks. For example, stroop has a very steep slope. The fact that one line works, suggests that the age effect is the same in the baseline and control condition, but why is that effect so much larger than in other tasks? Is it possible that there is some sort of carry over effect, for example, olders really do have more trouble on the control trials but that this leads them to go slower than they need to on baseline trials, perhaps to avoid errors? need to be careful about the scales here though... they are quite different, how big is the difference in slope if the scales are equated... but eyeball estimates of rise/run suggest the stroop slope is steeper.

Then looks at several other tasks.

Found that dual task performance (versus a single task baseline) does show a slight age difference of about 36ms. 

Global switching (switching between blocks of different tasks) also shows an age difference according to the brinley plot method

But local switching (switching between different tasks within a block) and the trail making task do not.

Finally does a meta-correlation/sem analysis showing that resistance to interference does not explain all that much variance in complex cognition (episodic mem, reasoning, and spatial ability), and that all the variance it does explain can be accounted for by speed of processing and working memory. ME: would be nice to see alternative models, perhaps in the original paper?},

uses simulations to see if reducing the gain parameter that governs how strongly units are activated given an input in a neural net model can simulate age effects in associative memory, specifically naveh-benjamin's finding that older adults have a bigger impairment for association rather than single items and when instructions emphasize actually learning associations rather than learning single items.

Their model consisted of an input layer which was split between a section for representing A item and a section for representing B items. A hidden layer was split into an Item A section, an Item B section, and a binding section that received inputs from the A and B sections of the input layer, and an output later with separate A and B sections. 

They were able to fit the basic pattern of data. The one thing I found odd was how they simulated instructions to study item versus associations. Studying associations was simulated by presenting both items in a pair at once, but studying items was simulated by presenting the items together AND presenting each separately (I think, the details are thin in the paper), so that simulated people are actually doing more 'studying' in the study items version.

None the less, it is cool and potentially important that the impact of study instructions can be simulated without assuming that older adults have some impairment in following the instructions or setting up an appropriate strategy.

@article{UndeEkst66,
	Annote = {Six years after underwood and postman's big psych review paper claiming
	that extra experimental interference driven by unit sequence and
	letter sequence interfenrece can explain much forgetting of lab learned
	materials during extra experimental retention intervals. This article
	start out by saying that tests of interference theory for extra experimental
	intervals have been generally negative. 
	
	Starts off with a nice summary of interference theory of forgetting.
	It was initially developed due the observation of retroactive interfenrece
	in list learning tasks. But it later became obvious that proactive
	interference from previously learned material was also a big factor.
	But studies of such pi found odd things like the fact that the impact
	of pi seems to increase with retention interval, required addition
	alf more mechanisms. Specifically the idea that previous associations
	interfere with current learning (eg in the a-b a-c paradigm) and
	therefore are extinguished during learning, but these tend to spontaneously
	recover over time leading to the bigger impact of pi as the interval
	increases. interference theory was very sucesfull in explaining forgetting
	in list learning experiments.
	
	Discuss. How postman and underwood extended this theory to provide
	an account of extraexperimental forgetting. With the main idea being
	that information learned in the past conflicts with info currently
	being learned, must be extinguished but hen recovers creating interference
	and forgetting on a later test. Another key idea is that interference
	and thus forgetting should be driven largely by similarity of the
	old and new material (eg the proposed u it and letter sequence interference
	gradients from underwood and postman 1960). 
	
	However, apparently in the intervening six years from the 1960 paper,
	a string of studies designed to be in accordance with how this extraexperimental
	version of interference theory supposes forgetting to occur failed
	to support the theory... Wormy checking a few of the references.
	
	
	One suggestion is that associations, verbal habits, formed outside
	the lab may be for some reason immune from causing interference,
	obviating the need for extinction and recovery. Specifically the
	suggest that there may be something special about habits that are
	learned to a very high level and learned through distributed rather
	than massed practice (as is presumably true of habits learned over
	a lifetime of language experience) therefore propose a lab experiment
	that varys the level of learning and the massed/distributed nature
	of learning. 
	
	Method
	
	Tow lists of 12 paired associates stimilus term was three letter word
	and response was two syllable adjective. One list was a-b the other
	a-c
	
	 Level of learning was manipulated by the number of learning trials
	for the a-b list: either 12 32 48 80 trials. 
	
	Nature of practice was manipulated by giving all trials in a singe
	sessionq for massed practice (mp) followed in the same session of
	learning of the a-c list to one perfect trial. 
	
	For distributed practice (dp) the trials were divided equally over
	four days. With the a-c list learned on the fourth day after the
	last set of a-b learning. 
	
	In both conditions theree was a final recall of a-c 24 hrs after its
	initial learning to criterion. They were given enough relearning
	trials to reach one perfect recall. Finally were given a free recall
	task where the stimuli terms were provided and ss recalled the response
	terms from both lists indicating which list it belonged to. 
	
	Learning was by the anticipation method. 
	
	Results
	
	Ab lists were learned well by all groups, a little better by the dp
	group especially in the 48 and 80 trial conditions. 
	
	Two measures of initial learning for the ac list were the number correct
	anticipations on the first three trials and the number of trials
	to criterion. While ther graphs look like there are differences due
	to practice distribution and number of ab trials, no effects were
	significant suggesting how the ab list was learned did not impact
	how the ac list was learned. 
	
	Some ab intrusions dis occur for ac learning, but the number decreased
	the more ab learning there were. 
	
	In terms of ab recall, distributed practice clearly did better. Level
	of learning seemed to have little impact for dp, for mp there was
	a trend toward a quadratic pattern such that recall was best with
	few or many ab trials but lower when there were a medium number of
	trials. 
	
	In the final recall of the ab list, scores were almost perfect for
	the distributed group. For the massed group, approximately two items
	were missed. Level of learning made little difference for either
	practice type. They argue based on the dp groups results on the second
	day (recall after a 24 hour per...},

	Abstract = {Comparisons of the published data on the density D of receptive fields of retinal ganglion cells and on the cortical magnification factor M indicated that M2 is directly proportional to D in primates. Therefore, the human M can be estimated for the principal meridians of the visual field from the density-distribution of retinal ganglion cells and from the density of the centralmost cones. Using the previously published empirical data, we estimated the values of the human M and express the values in four simple equations that can be used for finding the value of M for any location of the visual field. The monocular values of M are not radially symmetric. These analytically expressed values of M make it possible to predict contrast sensitivity and resolution for any location of the visual field. We measured contrast sensitivity functions at 25 different locations and found that the functions could be made similar by scaling the retinal dimensions of test gratings by the inverse values of M. Visual acuity and resolution could be predicted accurately for all retinal locations by means of a single constant multiplier of the estimated M. The results indicate that the functional and structural properties of the visual system are very closely and similarly related across the whole retina. Visual acuity, e.g., bears the same optimal relation to the density of sampling executed by retinal ganglion cells at all locations of the visual fields.},

	Annote = {Describes various actr buffers and their likely cortical localizations. The goal buffer is in the dlpfc. The retrieval buffer is in the vlpfc following hera. Manual buffer ctrls hands and is located in motor and somatosensory cortex. A visual buffer associated with the dorsal where path and another associated with the ventral what path. Critically, these buffers store the final results of processing from the systems to which the correspond. So the visual buffer for example depends on all of the visual areas downstream of it. 

Discuss the pallidum which sends inhibitory projections to the thalamus which in turn sends projections to other areas. The idea is the pallidum inhibits the thalamus which then prevents particular actions form other areas

Suggest that the basil gangla inhibit the pallidum. So if the basil gang inhibits a particular part of the pallidum, it stops sending inhibition to the thalamus which then allows a particular action to occur. This winner looses all system allows the basal gang to control action.   

Suggest that each buffer can hold on a single declarative unit at a time and the system can execute only a single production at a time. Therefore, for example, only one memory can be retrieved at once. 

Discuss the perceptual components with an example of a dual task that requires making both an auditory tone discrimination and a visual location discrimination at the same time. Behavioral data show that with practice the is essentially zero dual task cost. The model predictions are similar because most of the processing goes on is separate modules and the demands they place on the central production system tend not to overlap in time. However, the model generally does not allow for perfect independence between tasks because the production system places a central bottleneck on almost all processing. 

The goal system stores information such as goals necessary for keeping The current task on track. Use the example of planning moves in the tower of Hanoi problem. 

The declarative memory system is essentially a network of chunks with connections between them. Activation spreads through the network with retrieval success being a function of the chunks resting activation level and the activation fed into it from the cues through the associative network. 

Procedural memory is where production rules are shared and it operates somewhat similarly to declarative memory. Each production has a utiliy and it's utility determines its probability of being execuited. The utility is a function of the current goal and information in other module's buffers which determine the production's likelihood of accomplishing the goal, were it to be executed. Utility is then calculated as the product of probability of success times the value of the goal minus the cost, generally in time, of executing the production.

@article{AvidEtal02,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: A prevailing assumption in neuroimaging studies is that
	relatively low fMRI signals are due to weak neuronal activation,
	and, therefore, they are commonly ignored. However, lower fMRI signals
	may also result from intense activation by highly selective, albeit
	small, subsets of neurons in the imaged voxel. We report on an approach
	that could form a basis for resolving this ambiguity imposed by the
	low (mm range) spatial resolution of fMRI. Our approach employs fMR-adaptation
	as an indicator for highly active neuronal populations even when
	the measured fMRI signal is low. RESULTS: In this study, we first
	showed that fMRI-adaptation is diminished when overall neuronal activity
	is lowered substantially by reducing image contrast. We then applied
	the same adaptation paradigm, but this time we lowered the fMRI signal
	by changing object shape. While the overall fMRI signal in category-related
	regions such as the face-related pFs was drastically reduced for
	non-face stimuli, the adaptation level obtained for these stimuli
	remained high. We hypothesize that the relatively greater adaptation
	level following exposure to "nonoptimal" object shapes is indicative
	of small subsets of neurons responding vigorously to these "nonoptimal"
	objects even when the overall fMRI activity is low. CONCLUSIONS:
	Our results show that fMR-adaptation can be used to differentiate
	between neuronal activation patterns that appear similar in the overall
	fMRI signal. The results suggest that it may be possible to employ
	fMR-adaptation to reveal functionally heterogeneous islands of activity,
	which are too small to image using conventional imaging methods.},

@article{BancEtal94,
	Abstract = {Jackson (Brain 1898; 21: 580--90) observed that seizures arising in
	the medial temporal lobe may result in a `dreamy state', consisting
	of vivid memory-like hallucinations, and/or the sense of having previously
	lived through exactly the same situation (d{\'e}j{\`a} vu). Penfield
	demonstrated that the dreamy state can sometimes be evoked by electrical
	stimulation of the lateral temporal neocortex, especially the superior
	temporal gyrus. Halgren et al. (Brain 1978; 101: 83--117) showed
	that the dreamy state can be evoked by stimulation of the hippocampal
	formation and amygdala and Gloor (Brain 1990; 113: 1673--94) has
	suggested that it is evoked by lateral stimulation only when the
	resulting after-discharge spreads medially. In order to resolve the
	relative importance of these areas, we considered the mental phenomena
	observed in epileptic patients with electrodes stereotaxically implanted
	into different brain areas for seizure localization prior to surgical
	treatment. Sixteen patients, all with seizures involving the temporal
	lobe, experienced the dreamy state either as a result of spontaneous
	seizures (nine dreamy states in six patients), or due to electrical
	stimulation (43 in 14) or to chemical activation (five in three).
	D{\'e}j{\`a} vu and hallucinations of scenes were often evoked by
	different stimulations of the same electrode in the same patient.
	As Jackson had also observed, the dreamy state could occur alone
	but was often associated with epigastric phenomena and fear, and
	followed by loss of contact and oro-alimentary automatisms, and then
	by simple gestural automatisms, all characteristic of partial seizures
	beginning in the medial temporal lobe. Furthermore, as also emphasized
	by Jackson, the dreamy state was seldom associated with sensory illusions.
	Stimulation of either the neocortex (15 occurrences), anterior hippocampus
	(17) or amygdala (10) could evoke a dreamy state. However, since
	fewer hippocampal and amygdala leads were stimulated than temporal
	neocortical, the proportion of medial temporal electrodes where dreamy
	states could be evoked was much higher than in the neocortex. Most
	responsive lateral temporal sites were located in the superior temporal
	gyrus, rather than the middle temporal gyrus which was significantly
	less responsive. In 85\% of dreamy states evoked by medial temporal
	lobe stimulation, the discharge spread to the temporal neocortex;
	and in 53\% of dreamy states evoked by lateral temporal stimulation,
	the discharge spread medially. Considering all dreamy states, the
	amygdala was involved (as the stimulated structure, or as the site
	of ictal- or after-discharge) in 73\% of cases, the anterior hippocampus
	in 83\% and the temporal neocortex in 88\%. In every spontaneous
	seizure where the dreamy state was observed, the amygdala, anterior
	hippocampus and temporal neocortex were all involved (provided that
	they were recorded during the seizure). Thus, we conclude that the
	dreamy state probably depends upon a neuronal network that engages
	both medial and lateral aspects of the temporal lobe, and that the
	anterior hippocampus, amygdala and superior temporal gyrus have relatively
	priviledged access to this circuit.},

@article{BlaiShar95,
	Abstract = {Several regions in the rat brain contain neurons known as head-direction
	cells, which fire only when the rat's head is facing in a specific
	direction. Head-direction cells are influenced only by the direction
	of the head with respect to the static environmental surroundings,
	and not by the position of the head relative to the body. Each head-direction
	cell has its own preferred direction of firing, so that together,
	the population of cells provides a continuous signal of momentary
	directional heading. Here, head-direction cells were recorded from
	the post-subicular cortex (PSC) and anterodorsal nucleus (ADN) of
	the thalamus of freely moving rats. Cell activity was analyzed in
	relation to both momentary head direction, and the angular velocity
	of head turns. Head-direction cells in PSC maintained the same directional
	firing preference, regardless of the angular head velocity. By contrast,
	head-direction cells in ADN systematically shifted their directional
	firing preference, as a function of angular head velocity. The ADN
	cells always shifted their directional tuning peak to the left during
	clockwise head turns, and to the right during counterclockwise head
	turns. These results suggest that ADN neurons anticipate the future
	direction of the head, whereas PSC neurons encode the present direction
	of the head. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that neurons
	in PSC and ADN are reciprocally connected to form a thalamocortical
	circuit, which computes the directional position of the rat's head
	by integrating the angular motion of the head over time.},

@article{Boyn05,
	Abstract = {Somewhere between the retina and our conscious visual experience,
	the majority of the information impinging on the eye is lost. We
	are typically aware of only either the most salient parts of a visual
	scene or the parts that we are actively paying attention to. Recent
	research on visual neurons in monkeys is beginning to show how the
	brain both selects and discards incoming visual information. For
	example, what happens to the responses of visual neurons when attention
	is directed to one element, such as an oriented colored bar, embedded
	among an array of other oriented bars? Some of this research shows
	that attention to the oriented bar restricts the receptive field
	of visual neurons down to this single element. However, other research
	shows that attention to this single element affects the responses
	of neurons with receptive fields throughout the visual field. In
	this review, these two seemingly contradictory results are shown
	to actually be mutually consistent. A simple computational model
	is described that explains these results, and also provides a framework
	for predicting a variety of additional neurophysiological, neuroimaging
	and behavioral studies of attention.},

@article{FletEtal96,
	Abstract = {The effects of imagery and semantic relatedness on cued retrieval
	of word pairs were examined in a functional imaging study of healthy
	volunteers. Subjects underwent 12 PET scans, preceded by the paced
	presentation of 12 paired associates. The associates were dichotomized
	into imageable and non-imageable groups. Within each group, the strength
	of semantic association between members of pairs was varied in an
	ordinal fashion. Subsequently, neural activity was measured while
	subjects were cued with the first item of each pair and required
	to recall the associated word. Recall of imageable words, when compared
	with non-imageable ones, was associated with activation of the precuneus,
	consistent with our hypothesis that this region is important in visual
	imagery at episodic retrieval. The reverse comparison, non-imageable
	versus imageable recall, was associated with activation of the left
	dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Within both imageable and non-imageable
	groups, decreasing semantic association showed a corresponding increase
	in frontal activity bilaterally. One possible explanation is that
	of a practice-related effect, weaker-linked pairs having a greater
	number of pre-scan presentations. However, this explanation is incomplete
	as the most semantically distant, and most rehearsed, pairs (randomly
	linked) were associated with a reversal of this effect. This finding
	can be explained if frontal activity is associated with the difficulty
	of eliminating inappropriate responses at retrieval. For both randomly
	linked pairs and closely related pairs it is more likely that erroneous
	responses will be generated and, therefore, the work done to eliminate
	them will be greater. Our findings indicate that patterns of neural
	activity during cued recall depend upon the nature of the material
	and on the degree of association between the cue and the response.},

@article{CabeEtal01,
	Abstract = {To investigate the types of memory traces recovered by the medial
	temporal lobe (MTL), neural activity during veridical and illusory
	recognition was measured with the use of functional MRI (fMRI). Twelve
	healthy young adults watched a videotape segment in which two speakers
	alternatively presented lists of associated words, and then the subjects
	performed a recognition test including words presented in the study
	lists (True items), new words closely related to studied words (False
	items), and new unrelated words (New items). The main finding was
	a dissociation between two MTL regions: whereas the hippocampus was
	similarly activated for True and False items, suggesting the recovery
	of semantic information, the parahippocampal gyrus was more activated
	for True than for False items, suggesting the recovery of perceptual
	information. The study also yielded a dissociation between two prefrontal
	cortex (PFC) regions: whereas bilateral dorsolateral PFC was more
	activated for True and False items than for New items, possibly reflecting
	monitoring of retrieved information, left ventrolateral PFC was more
	activated for New than for True and False items, possibly reflecting
	semantic processing. Precuneus and lateral parietal regions were
	more activated for True and False than for New items. Orbitofrontal
	cortex and cerebellar regions were more activated for False than
	for True items. In conclusion, the results suggest that activity
	in anterior MTL regions does not distinguish True from False, whereas
	activity in posterior MTL regions does.},

	Abstract = {Numerous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have reported that the medial temporal lobe (MTL) is activated to a greater extent when subjects encounter novel items as compared with familiar ones. However, it remains unclear whether the novelty signals in the MTL are modulated by the criteria for old/new recognition judgments. In this study, we used fMRI to test our hypothesis that when subjects encounter items similar to previously encountered ones, the novelty signals in the MTL will differ depending on whether the subjects focus on the perceptual features or the semantic aspects of the items. The subjects studied a series of photographs and were later asked to make a recognition judgment of (a) Same items (items identical to those seen during encoding), (b) Similar items (items similar to but not identical to those seen during encoding), and (c) New items (unstudied items) in two types of tasks: Perceptual and Semantic. The subjects judged whether the items were perceptually identical to those seen during encoding in the Perceptual task and whether the items were semantically identical to those seen during encoding in the Semantic task. The left anterior hippocampus was activated when subjects were presented with New items relative to Same items in both tasks. In addition, the hippocampal activity in response to the Similar items was increased only in the Perceptual, but not the Semantic task. Our results indicate that the novelty signals in the hippocampus can be modulated by criteria for old/new recognition judgments.},

	En route to this interpretation, quantitative relationships that

	may operate in the two paradigms but that the similarity parameters
	that determine performance change systematically according to the

	Abstract = {Synchronous population activity is prevalent in neurones of the central
	nervous system and experimentally captured as oscillatory electric
	fields, the frequency of which can represent the state of the neural
	circuit, e.g. theta (approximately 5 Hz) and gamma (approximately
	40 Hz). Such field oscillations, however, are not merely a result
	of coherent neuronal activity. They may also play active roles in
	information processing in the brain. In this study, we observed that,
	in cultured hippocampal slices, CA3 pyramidal cells responded to
	single-pulse stimuli with monosynaptic and polysynaptic potentials
	and firing spikes which occurred after variable latencies. The variability
	of the spike latencies was greatly reduced in the presence of weak
	electric field oscillations, especially the oscillation in the gamma-band
	frequency range, that per se induced only small fluctuations in the
	subthreshold membrane potential, and this effect was inhibited by
	blockade of NMDA receptor activity. Furthermore, the latency of the
	firing spikes changed if the stimulus was applied at a different
	phase of the imposed gamma oscillations. These results may suggest
	that the background field oscillations serve as an extracellular
	time reference and assure accurate and stable decoding of a memory
	trace present in cortical feedback networks.},

	Abstract = {The examination of recognition memory confidence judgements indicates
	that there are two separate components or processes underlying episodic
	memory. A model that accounts for these results is described in which
	a recollection process and a familiarity process are assumed to contribute
	to recognition memory performance. Recollection is assumed to reflect
	a threshold process whereby qualitative information about the study
	event is retrieved, whereas familiarity reflects a classical signal-detection
	process whereby items exceeding a familiarity response criterion
	are accepted as having been studied. Evidence from cognitive, neuropsychological
	and neuroimaging studies indicate that the model is in agreement
	with the existing recognition results, and indicate that recollection
	and familiarity are behaviourally, neurally and phenomenologically
	distinct memory retrieval processes.},

	Abstract = {Visual cortical responses are usually attenuated by repetition, a
	phenomenon known as repetition suppression (RS). Here, we use multivoxel
	pattern analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
	data to show that RS co-occurs with the converse phenomenon (repetition
	enhancement, RE) in a single cortical region. We presented human
	volunteers with short sequences of repeated faces and measured brain
	activity using fMRI. In an independently defined face-responsive
	extrastriate region, the response of each voxel to repetition (RS
	vs. RE) was consistent across scanner runs, and multivoxel patterns
	for both RS and RE voxels were stable. Moreover, RS and RE voxels
	responded to repetition with dissociable latencies and exhibited
	different patterns of connectivity with lower and higher visual regions.
	Computational simulations demonstrated that these effects must be
	due to differences in repetition sensitivity, and not feature selectivity.
	These findings establish that 2 classes of repetition responses coexist
	within 1 visual region and support models acknowledging this distinction,
	such as predictive coding models where perception requires the computation
	of both predictions (which are enhanced by repetition) and prediction
	errors (which are suppressed by repetition).},

@article{KahnAgui12,
	Abstract = {Separate neuroscience experiments have examined two properties of
	neural coding for perceptual stimuli. Adaptation studies seek a graded
	recovery from neural adaptation with ever greater dissimilarity between
	pairs of stimuli. Studies of prototype effects test for a larger
	absolute response to a stimulus which is distant from the center
	of a stimulus space. While intellectually distinct, these effects
	are confounded in measurement in standard neuroscience paradigms
	and can be mistaken for one another. Stimuli which are more distinctive
	are less subject to adaptation from perceptual neighbors. Therefore,
	a putative prototype effect may simply result from greater adaptation
	of prototypical stimuli by other stimuli in the experiment. Conversely,
	stimulus pairs which are the most perceptually distant from one another,
	and therefore expected to show the greatest recovery from adaptation,
	disproportionately draw from the extremes of the stimulus space.
	Thus, an apparent neural similarity effect may be created by an underlying
	prototype representation. We simulate BOLD fMRI results driven by
	each possible effect and demonstrate spurious results in support
	of the complementary effect. We then present an example fMRI experiment
	that demonstrates the confound and how it may be minimized. Finally,
	we discuss the implications of this intrinsic confound for studies
	of perceptual representation, neural coding, and category learning.},

@article{HeinEtal98,
	Annote = {This study examined the extent to which decisions about category
	membership (between category structure) are dependent on or dissociable
	from the typically structure (within category structure) of categories.
	To this end, behavioral and event-related brain potential (ERP) measurements
	were obtained in a category verification task that incorporated a
	context manipulation (list composition effect) that was previously
	shown to affect membership verification. In a German and an American
	English version of the experiment, pairs of words were presented
	and subjects were asked to decide whether or not the second word
	was an exemplar of the superordinate indicated by the first word.
	Both versions yielded similar results. The behavioral data showed
	that both typicality and context manipulation affected the verification
	times for the true exemplars. Furthermore, atypical true exemplars
	were affected more by context manipulation than mere typical ones.
	By contrast, the N400 component of the ERPs elicited by the true
	exemplars was influenced by typicality, but invariant in the face
	of the context manipulation. These results underscore the previously
	shown dissociation between reaction times and N400 changes and suggest
	that category membership decision (as reflected in verification times)
	and semantic relatedness or typicality of an exemplar (as reflected
	in N400 modulation) can vary independently from each other and, therefore,
	likely index the activity of different brain systems.},

	Annote = {Point out the importance of the grey area between older adults clearly experiencing some sort of dementia and older adults who are clearly healthy. Say there are two categories within this grey area Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) people who have objective, but sub-dementia, impairments on standard tests, and Subjective Memory Complaint (SMC) individuals who complain of memory decline that is not apparent on clinical measures. MCI does predict transition to dementia but it is not clear if SMC does.

Their goal is to used EEG to see if there are differences between these different categories. 

Use a source localization technique to see if different frequency bands peak in different brain areas for different categories of patients. The main finding seems to be that frontal delta is higher in amnesiac-MCI and SMC than in normal controls, while parietal alpha is lower. I just have no confidence that the localization technique is reasonable....},

	Abstract = {Aging has been associated with a decline in memory abilities dependent
	on hippocampal processing. We investigated whether the functional
	interactions between the hippocampus and related cortical areas were
	modified by age. Young and old subjects' brain activity was measured
	using positron emission tomography (PET) while they performed a short-term
	memory task (delayed visual discrimination) in which they determined
	which of two successively presented sine-wave gratings had the highest
	spatial frequency. Behavioral performance was equal for the two groups.
	Partial least squares (PLS) analysis of PET images identified a hippocampal
	voxel whose activity was similarly correlated with performance across
	groups. Using this voxel as a seed, a second PLS analysis identified
	cortical regions functionally connected to the hippocampus. Quantification
	of the neural interactions with structural equation modeling suggested
	that a different hippocampal network supported performance in the
	elderly. Unlike the neural network engaged by the young, which included
	prefrontal cortex Brodmann's area (BA) 10, fusiform gyrus, and posterior
	cingulate gyrus, the network recruited by the old included more anterior
	areas, i.e., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA 9/46), middle cingulate
	gyrus, and caudate nucleus. Recruitment of a distinct corticolimbic
	network for visual memory in the elderly suggests that age-related
	neurobiological deterioration not only results in focal changes but
	also in the modification of large-scale network operations.},

@article{GothEtal01,
	Annote = {In rats shuttling between a variably placed landmark of origin
  and a fixed goal, place fields of hippocampal CA1 cells encode location in
  two spatial reference frames. On the initial part of the outbound journey,
  place fields encode location with respect to the origin while on the final
  segment, place fields are aligned with the goal (Gothard et al., 1996b). An
  abrupt switch of reference frame can be induced experimentally by shortening
  the distance between the origin and the goal. Two linked hypotheses
  concerning this effect were addressed: (1) that the persistent,
  landmark-referenced firing results from some internal dynamic process (e.g.,
	  path integration or `momentum') and is not a result of maintained
  sensory input from the landmark of origin; and (2) that this hypothetical
  process is generated by connections either within CA3 or between CA3 and
  CA1, in which case the effect might be absent from the dentate gyrus.
  Neuronal ensemble recordings were made simultaneously from CA1 and the
  dentate gyrus as rats shuttled on a linear track between a variably located
box and a goal, under light or dark conditions. The box-referenced firing
persisted significantly longer in the dark in both hippocampal subfields,
	suggesting a competitive interaction between an internal dynamic process
	and external sensory cues. The similarity between reference frame
	transitions in the dentate gyrus and the CA1 region suggests that this
	process probably occurs before CA3, possibly in the entorhinal cortex or
	subiculum.},

@article{EwbaEtal12,
	Abstract = {Repetition suppression (RS) (or functional magnetic resonance imaging
	adaptation) refers to the reduction in blood oxygen level-dependent
	signal following repeated presentation of a stimulus. RS is frequently
	used to investigate the role of face-selective regions in human visual
	cortex and is commonly thought to be a "localized" effect, reflecting
	fatigue of a neuronal population representing a given stimulus. In
	contrast, predictive coding theories characterize RS as a consequence
	of "top-down" changes in between-region modulation. Differentiating
	between these accounts is crucial for the correct interpretation
	of RS effects in the face-processing network. Here, dynamic causal
	modeling revealed that different mechanisms underlie different forms
	of RS to faces in occipitotemporal cortex. For both familiar and
	unfamiliar faces, repetition of identical face images (same size)
	was associated with changes in "forward" connectivity between the
	occipital face area (OFA) and the fusiform face area (FFA) (OFA-to-FFA).
	In contrast, RS across image size was characterized by altered "backward"
	connectivity (FFA-to-OFA). In addition, evidence was higher for models
	in which information projected directly into both OFA and FFA, challenging
	the role of OFA as the input stage of the face-processing network.
	These findings suggest "size-invariant" RS to faces is a consequence
	of interactions between regions rather than being a localized effect.},

@article{VannEtal12,
	Abstract = {The reduction of neural activity in response to repeated stimuli, repetition suppression, is one of the most robust experience-related cortical dynamics known to cognitive neuroscience. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies during episodic memory encoding have demonstrated repetition suppression in the hippocampus and this reduction has been linked to successful memory formation. An emerging body of functional imaging evidence suggests that the posteromedial cortex, in addition to the medial temporal lobes, may have a pivotal role in successful episodic memory. This area typically deactivates during initial memory encoding, but its functional changes in response to repetitive encoding remain poorly specified. Here, we investigate the repetition-related changes in the posteromedial cortex as well as the hippocampus while the participants underwent an fMRI experiment involving repetitive encoding of face-name pairs. During the first encoding trial of face-name pairs, significant activation in the hippocampus was observed. The second and third encoding trials demonstrated a repetition suppression effect in the hippocampus, indicated by a stepwise decrease of activation. In contrast, the posteromedial cortex demonstrated significant deactivation during the initial encoding trial of face-name pairs. The second and third encoding trials demonstrated a stepwise decrease of deactivation, repetition enhancement, with activity at or above baseline levels in the final encoding trial. These findings demonstrate that hippocampus repetition suppression as well as posteromedial repetition enhancement is related to successful encoding processes and are discussed in relation to the default mode hypothesis as well as potential implications for understanding late-life amnestic disorders.

	have been studied previously, but they have never been compared with
	the correlates of explicit memory while holding task conditions constant
	or while using a procedure that ensured that the neural correlates
	were not 'contaminated' by explicit memory. Here we use scalp-recorded
	event-related brain potentials to identify neural activity associated
	with implicit and explicit memory during the performance of a recognition
	memory task. Relative to new words, recently studied words produced
	activity in three neuroanatomically and functionally dissociable
	neural populations. One of these populations was activated whether
	or not the word was consciously recognized, and its activity therefore
	represents a neural correlate of implicit memory. Thus, when task
	and memory contamination effects are eliminated, the neural correlates

	Annote = {$\blacksquare$ The authors present a new method for analyzing episodes
	of oscillatry activity and apply this method to the analysis of iEEG
	data during maze learning. Using a larger dataset than used by Kahana
	et al (1999), and more careful controls for epileptic artifacts,
	Caplan et al demonstrate that the maze-length effect (increased theta
	activity in longer mazes) was specific to the theta and low alpha
	bands. Hypothesizing that the maze length effect reflected increased
	encoding/retrieval difficulty in longer mazes, they examined the
	relation between theta episodes and time-per-junction, the time subjects
	spend deliberating at a junction before making a turn. Contrary to
	expectations, this measure of encoding/retrieval difficulty did not
	correlate with theta activity. Instead, gamma activity increased
	during periods of increased deliberation at maze junctions. These
	findings suggest that theta's role in cognition is a general one,
	with theta activity increasing during periods of hightened attention,
	but not as a specific response to the difficulty of individual choices.
	This interpretation is also consistent with Raghavachari's findings
	of gated theta oscillations during the Sternberg working memory task.},

	from recurrent networks operating at high gain. However, such networks

	can dramatically modify the degree of amplification, and (iii) they

	Abstract = {In three experiments, different methodologies, measures, and items
	were employed to address the question of whether, and to what extent,
	membership in a semantic category is all or none (i.e., absolute)
	or a matter of degree (i.e., graded). Resemblance theory claims that
	categorization is based on similarity, and because similarity is
	graded, category membership may also be graded. Psychological essentialism
	asserts that categorization is based on the presumption of the category
	essence. Because artifactual (e.g., FURNITURE) and natural (e.g.,
	FRUIT) categories have different sorts of essences, artifacts and
	natural kinds may be categorized in qualitatively different manners.
	The results converged onthe finding of a robust domain difference
	in category structure: Artifactual categories were more graded than
	natural categories. Furthermore, typicality reliably predicted absolute
	category membership, but failed to predict graded category membership.
	These results suggest that resemblance theory and psychological essentialism
	may provide a concerted account of representation and categorization
	across domains.},

	activation with millimeter spatial resolution but is limited in its
	temporal resolution to the order of seconds. Here, we describe a
	technique that combines structural and functional MRI with magnetoencephalography
	(MEG) to obtain spatiotemporal maps of human brain activity with
	millisecond temporal resolution. This new technique was used to obtain
	dynamic statistical parametric maps of cortical activity during semantic
	processing of visually presented words. An initial wave of activity
	was found to spread rapidly from occipital visual cortex to temporal,
	parietal, and frontal areas within 185 ms, with a high degree of
	temporal overlap between different areas. Repetition effects were
	observed in many of the same areas following this initial wave of
	activation, providing evidence for the involvement of feedback mechanisms
	in repetition priming.},

	Annote = {We demonstrate that event-related coherence in the human EEG, computed
	using a short-time Fourier wavelet decomposition, shows multiple
	synchronization frequencies with abrupt event-related jumps in coherence
	frequency and, less frequently, in synchronization lag. Previous
	studies of EEG coherence have suffered from confounds arising from
	the large projection areas for all but the most superficial brain
	generator configurations. Since projections from different generators
	overlap widely, single scalp electrode channels typically pick up
	and sum activity from a relatively large number of discrete EEG sources.
	Changes in coherence between two scalp electrode channels thus may
	reflect any of several types of changes in the summed mixtures of
	activities they record. Computing coherence between independent components
	(ICs) of the EEG, derived using the infomax ICA algorithm, increases
	the functional specificity of the derived results. Study of event-related
	coherence between ICs suggests that cooperativity between brain networks
	may be accomplished through joint oscillatory processes operating
	at multiple discrete (theta to gamma) frequencies, only some of which
	may appear as peaks in the EEG power spectra, and these oscillatory
	linkages may be transiently created, broken or transformed by experimental
	events.},

	Annote = {Populations of hippocampal neurons were recorded simultaneously in rats shuttling on a track between a fixed reward site at one end and a movable reward site, mounted in a sliding box, at the opposite end. While the rat ran toward the fixed site, the box was moved. The rat returned to the box in its new position. On the initial part of all journeys, cells fired at fixed distances from the origin, whereas on the final part, cells fired at fixed distances from the destination. Thus, on outward journeys from the box, with the box behind the rat, the position representation must have been updated by path integration. Farther along the journey, the place field map became aligned on the basis of external stimuli. The spatial representation was quantified in terms of population vectors. During shortened journeys, the vector shifted from an alignment with the origin to an alignment with the destination. The dynamics depended on the degree of mismatch with respect to the full-length journey. For small mismatches, the vector moved smoothly through intervening coordinates until the mismatch was corrected. For large mismatches, it jumped abruptly to the new coordinate. Thus, when mismatches occur, path integration and external cues interact competitively to control place-cell firing. When the same box was used in a different environment, it controlled the alignment of a different set of place cells. These data suggest that although map alignment can be controlled by landmarks, hippocampal neurons do not explicitly represent objects or events.},

	Abstract = {Stimulus repetition reduces neural response in cortical areas. Such adaptation is used in functional magnetic resonance imaging to infer the selectivity of neuronal populations; however, the mechanisms of adaptation remain elusive, especially in higher areas. We measured adaptation of spiking activity and local field potentials (LFPs) in macaque inferior temporal (IT) cortex for parameterized shapes by comparing tuning for test stimuli following a brief adaptation with predictions derived from different models of adaptation. Adaptation was similar during passive fixation or an attention-demanding task. We found consistent adaptation of spiking activity and LFP power in high- (gamma) but not low-frequency bands when repeating shapes. Contrary to sharpening models, repetition did not affect shape selectivity. The degree of similarity between adapter and test shapes was a stronger determinant of adaptation than was the response to the adapter. Adaptation still occurred when adapter and test stimuli did not spatially overlap, but adaptation was stronger for same, compared with different, adapters and test stimulus positions. These adaptation effects were similar for spiking and for gamma activity. In conclusion, adaptation of IT spiking activity and LFPs in IT is strongly dependent on feature similarities in the adapter and test stimuli, in agreement with input, but not firing-rate fatigue models.},

	Abstract = {The present study compared the effects of repeated stimulus presentations
	on the event-related potential (ERP) of humans and rats. Both species
	were presented with a total of 100 auditory stimuli, divided into
	four blocks of 25 stimuli. By means of wavelet denoising, single-trial
	ERPs were established in both humans and rats. The auditory ERPs
	were characterized by the presence of two positive and two negative
	waves in both humans and rats, albeit with different latencies in
	the two species (P1, N1, P2, and N2). The results showed decreased
	amplitudes within blocks for the N1, P2, and N2 components in humans
	and for the N1 and P2 components in rats. Decreased amplitudes across
	blocks were found for the N2 component in humans and for the P2 and
	N2 components in rats. In both humans and rats, response decrements
	within a block were thus most prominent for the early ERP components,
	whereas the changes across blocks were most prominent for the later
	components. These results suggest a correspondence of the ERP correlates
	of elemental stimulus processing between humans and rats. It is further
	suggested that the observed amplitude reductions may reflect habituation
	and/or recovery cycle processes.},

	In large networks, elements of the synaptic connectivity matrix can

	from random matrix theory highly relevant. Unfortunately, classic
	results on the eigenvalue spectra of random matrices do not apply
	to synaptic connectivity matrices because of the constraint that

@article{VanSEtal07,
	Abstract = {The EEG was recorded in 21 participants who were required to make
	'old' vs. 'new' decisions during a continuous recognition memory
	task with massed word repetitions (i.e., immediate repetitions) and
	spaced word repetitions (i.e., with six intervening words). After
	completion of the recognition task, they were given an unexpected
	free recall task. Behavioral measures revealed better recognition
	but worse free recall with massed repetitions, and worse recognition
	but better free recall with spaced repetitions. The ERP data revealed
	that for the 350- to 450-ms time window (representing the N400) the
	repetition effect was widely distributed across central and parietal
	scalp sites and was larger with massed than with spaced word repetitions.
	Peak latencies of the late positive complex (LPC) at Pz were shorter
	for massed than for spaced repetitions. Mean area around peak measures
	at Pz indicated that the LPC repetition effect was also larger with
	massed than with spaced repetitions. In the frequency domain, we
	found a theta (4-6 Hz) induced band power (IBP) repetition effect
	for massed repetitions, with theta power in the 250- to 625-ms time
	window being larger to repeated words than to new words. For spaced
	repetitions, we found an upper alpha (10-12 Hz) IBP repetition effect
	with the upper alpha power in the 625- to 1000-ms time window being
	smaller to repeated words than to new words. With spaced repetitions,
	we further found that larger LPC and theta IBP repetition effects
	were associated with smaller recall performance enhancements. The
	results mainly support a deficient processing account of the spacing
	effect.},

	Abstract = {Computational models based on hippocampal connectivity have proposed
	that CA3 is uniquely positioned as an autoassociative memory network,
	capable of performing the competing functions of pattern completion
	and pattern separation. Recently, three independent studies, two
	using parallel neurophysiological recording methods and one using
	immediate-early gene imaging, have examined the responses of CA3
	and CA1 ensembles to alterations of environmental context in rats.
	The results provide converging evidence that CA3 is capable of performing
	nonlinear transformations of sensory input patterns, whereas CA1
	may represent changes in input in a more linear fashion.},

	Abstract = {To address questions about human memory's dependence on the coincidental
	environmental contexts in which events occur, we review studies of
	incidental environmental context-dependent memory in humans and report
	a meta-analysis. Our theoretical approach to the issue stems from
	Glenberg's (1997) contention that introspective thought (e.g., remembering,
	conceptualizing) requires cognitive resources normally used to represent
	the immediate environment. We propose that if tasks encourage processing
	of noncontextual information (i.e., introspective thought) at input
	and/or at test, then both learning and memory will be less dependent
	on the ambient environmental contexts in which those activities occur.
	The meta-analysis showed that across all studies, environmental context
	effects were reliable, and furthermore, that the use of noncontextual
	cues during learning (overshadowing) and at test (outshining), as
	well as mental reinstatement of appropriate context cues at test,
	all reduce the effect of environmental manipulations. We conclude
	that environmental context-dependent memory effects are less likely
	to occur under conditions in which the immediate environment is likely
	to be suppressed.},

	Annote = {Episodic memory is a neurocognitive (brain/mind) system, uniquely
	different from other memory systems, that enables human beings to
	remember past experiences. The notion of episodic memory was first
	proposed some 30 years ago. At that time it was defined in terms
	of materials and tasks. It was subsequently refined and elaborated
	in terms of ideas such as self, subjective time, and autonoetic consciousness.
	This chapter provides a brief history of the concept of episodic
	memory, describes how it has changed (indeed greatly changed) since
	its inception, considers criticisms of it, and then discusses supporting
	evidence provided by (a) neuropsychological studies of patterns of
	memory impairment caused by brain damage, and (b) functional neuroimaging
	studies of patterns of brain activity of normal subjects engaged
	in various memory tasks. I also suggest that episodic memory is a
	true, even if as yet generally unappreciated, marvel of nature.},

	Abstract = {The hypothesis was tested whether event-related power shifts in the
	upper alpha band are specifically related to semantic memory processes.
	In Expt. 1 subjects had to judge whether pairs of sequentially presented
	words (W1-W2) were semantically congruent. In the following experiments
	subjects were presented the W1 words of Expt. 1 and were asked to
	perform a free association task in Expt. 2 and a cued recall task
	in Expt. 3. It is assumed that semantic memory demands dominate in
	Expt. 1, whereas working memory demands dominate in Expt. 3 and that
	Expt. 2 takes an intermediate position with respect to both types
	of task demands. A significant task-related power change that responds
	selectively to semantic processing demands was found for the upper
	alpha band and over the left side of the scalp. The lower alpha band,
	on the other hand, most likely reflects unspecific processing demands
	such as attention. A more general interpretation of these findings
	is that different cognitive processes such as semantic memory, perceptual
	encoding and attentional processes are reflected by band power changes
	in different and rather narrow frequency bands over localized regions
	in the brain.},

	Abstract = {According to dual-process models, recognition memory is supported
	by distinct retrieval processes known as familiarity and recollection.
	Important evidence supporting the dual-process framework has come
	from studies using event-related brain potentials (ERPs). These studies
	have identified two topographically distinct ERP correlates of recognition
	memory--the ``parietal'' and ``mid-frontal'' old/new effects--that
	are dissociated by variables that selectively modulate recollection
	and familiarity, respectively. We evaluate the extent to which ERP
	data support dual-process models in light of the proposal that recollection
	is a continuous rather than a discrete memory process. We also examine
	the claim that the putative ERP index of familiarity is a reflection
	of implicit rather than explicit memory. We conclude that ERP findings
	continue to offer strong support for the dual-process perspective.},

	Abstract = {Stimulus repetition associates with neural activity reductions during
	tasks that elicit behavioral priming. Here we present direct evidence
	for a quantitative relation between neural activity reductions and
	behavioral priming. Fifty-four subjects performed a word classification
	task while being scanned with functional MRI. Activity reductions
	were found in multiple high-level cortical regions including those
	within the prefrontal cortex. Importantly, activity within several
	of these regions, including the prefrontal cortex, correlated with
	behavior such that greater activity reductions associated with faster
	performance. Whole-brain correlational analyses confirmed the observation
	of anatomic overlap between regions showing activity reductions and
	those showing direct brain-behavioral correlations. The finding of
	a quantitative relation between neural and behavioral effects in
	frontal regions suggests that repetition reduces frontally mediated
	processing in a manner that ultimately facilitates behavior.},

	Abstract = {In 4 experiments, participants were presented with lists of between
	1 and 15 words for tests of immediate memory. For all tasks, participants
	tended to initiate recall with the first word on the list for short
	lists. As the list length was increased, so there was a decreased
	tendency to start with the first list item; and, when free to do
	so, participants showed an increased tendency to start with one of
	the last 4 list items. In all tasks, the start position strongly
	influenced the shape of the resultant serial position curves: When
	recall started at Serial Position 1, elevated recall of early list
	items was observed; when recall started toward the end of the list,
	there were extended recency effects. These results occurred under
	immediate free recall (IFR) and different variants of immediate serial
	recall (ISR) and reconstruction of order (RoO) tasks. We argue that
	these findings have implications for the relationship between IFR
	and ISR and between rehearsal and recall.},

	Annote = {Attepmt to asscess the recolection/familarity dual process account of episodic memory from an individual differences prepsective.

Gave people free recall, item recognition, and source memory tasks. The argument being that recognition can contribute to all of the tasks, but that familarity can only guide recognition. Also included WMspan and gf measures.

Found that seperate recall, recognition, and source memory latent variables fit the data best. Also tried a recolection latent variable (all of hte memoty tasks load onto it) and a familarity latent variable (only recognition tasks load onto it) with zero correlation between the two and found it fit similarly to the 3 factor model. 

Argue that recolection contributes to WM but familarity does not (though familarity does relate to gf).

	This paper discusses recent analyses and extensions of the LCA model.
	First, it reviews the dynamics and examines the conditions that make
	the model achieve optimal performance. Second, it shows that nonlinearities
	of the type present in biological neurons improve performance when
	the number of choice alternatives increases. Third, the model is
	extended to value-based choice, where it is shown that nonlinearities
	in the value function explain risk aversion in risky choice and preference

@article{FurlEtal07,
	Abstract = {Previous studies have shown reductions of the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal in response to repetition of specific visual stimuli. We examined how adaptation affects the neural responses associated with categorization behavior, using face adaptation aftereffects. Adaptation to a given facial category biases categorization towards non-adapted facial categories in response to presentation of ambiguous morphs. We explored a hypothesis, posed by recent psychophysical studies, that these adaptation-induced categorizations are mediated by activity in relatively advanced stages within the occipitotemporal visual processing stream. Replicating these studies, we find that adaptation to a facial expression heightens perception of non-adapted expressions. Using comparable behavioral methods, we also show that adaptation to a specific identity heightens perception of a second identity in morph faces. We show both expression and identity effects to be associated with heightened anterior medial temporal lobe activity, specifically when perceiving the non-adapted category. These regions, incorporating bilateral anterior ventral rhinal cortices, perirhinal cortex and left anterior hippocampus are regions previously implicated in high-level visual perception. These categorization effects were not evident in fusiform or occipital gyri, although activity in these regions was reduced to repeated faces. The findings suggest that adaptation-induced perception is mediated by activity in regions downstream to those showing reductions due to stimulus repetition.},

	Abstract = {The invariant properties of human cortical neurons cannot be studied
	directly by fMRI due to its limited spatial resolution. One voxel
	obtained from a fMRI scan contains several hundred thousands neurons.
	Therefore, the fMRI signal may average out a heterogeneous group
	of highly selective neurons. Here, we present a novel experimental
	paradigm for fMRI, functional magnetic resonance-adaptation (fMR-A),
	that enables to tag specific neuronal populations within an area
	and investigate their functional properties. This approach contrasts
	with conventional mapping methods that measure the averaged activity
	of a region. The application of fMR-A to study the functional properties
	of cortical neurons proceeds in two stages: First, the neuronal population
	is adapted by repeated presentation of a single stimulus. Second,
	some property of the stimulus is varied and the recovery from adaptation
	is assessed. If the signal remains adapted, it will indicate that
	the neurons are invariant to that attribute. However, if the fMRI
	signal will recover from the adapted state it would imply that the
	neurons are sensitive to the property that was varied. Here, an application
	of fMR-A for studying the invariant properties of high-order object
	areas (lateral occipital complex--LOC) to changes in object size,
	position, illumination and rotation is presented. The results show
	that LOC is less sensitive to changes in object size and position
	compared to changes of illumination and viewpoint. fMR-A can be extended
	to other neuronal systems in which adaptation is manifested and can
	be used with event-related paradigms as well. By manipulating experimental
	parameters and testing recovery from adaptation it should be possible
	to gain insight into the functional properties of cortical neurons
	which are beyond the spatial resolution limits imposed by conventional
	fMRI.},

	Abstract = {Measurements of repetition suppression with functional magnetic resonance
	imaging (fMRI adaptation) have been used widely to probe neuronal
	population response properties in human cerebral cortex. fMRI adaptation
	techniques assume that fMRI repetition suppression reflects neuronal
	adaptation, an assumption that has been challenged on the basis of
	evidence that repetition-related response changes may reflect unrelated
	factors, such as attention and stimulus expectation. Specifically,
	Summerfield et al. (Summerfield C, Trittschuh EH, Monti JM, Mesulam
	MM, Egner T. 2008. Neural repetition suppression reflects fulfilled
	perceptual expectations. Nat Neurosci. 11:1004-1006) reported that
	the relative frequency of stimulus repetitions and non-repetitions
	influenced the magnitude of repetition suppression in the fusiform
	face area, suggesting that stimulus expectation accounted for most
	of the effect of repetition. We confirm that stimulus expectation
	can significantly influence fMRI repetition suppression throughout
	visual cortex and show that it occurs with long as well as short
	adaptation durations. However, the effect was attention dependent:
	When attention was diverted away from the stimuli, the effects of
	stimulus expectation completely disappeared. Nonetheless, robust
	and significant repetition suppression was still evident. These results
	suggest that fMRI repetition suppression reflects a combination of
	neuronal adaptation and attention-dependent expectation effects that
	can be experimentally dissociated. This implies that with an appropriate
	experimental design, fMRI adaptation can provide valid measures of
	neuronal adaptation and hence response specificity.},

	Abstract = {Repeating object images produces stimulus-specific repetition suppression

	repetition on functional selectivity are largely unknown. We investigated
	the effects of short-lagged (SL, immediate) and long-lagged (LL,

	VTC using high-resolution fMRI. We asked whether repetition produces
	scaling or sharpening of fMRI responses both within category-selective
	regions as well as in the distributed response pattern across VTC.
	Results illustrate that repetition effects across time scales vary
	quantitatively along an anterior-posterior axis and qualitatively
	along a lateral-medial axis. In lateral VTC, both SL and LL repetitions
	produce proportional fMRI-A with no change in either selectivity
	or distributed responses as predicted by a scaling model. Further,
	there is larger fMRI-A in anterior subregions irrespective of category
	selectivity. Medial VTC exhibits similar scaling effects during SL

	distributed pattern of responses vary with category in medial VTC
	as predicted by a sharpening model. Specifically, there is larger
	fMRI-A for nonpreferred categories compared with the preferred category,
	and category selectivity does not predict fMRI-A across the pattern
	of distributed response. Finally, simulations indicate that different
	neural mechanisms likely underlie fMRI-A in medial compared to lateral
	VTC. These results have important implications for future fMRI-A
	experiments because they suggest that fMRI-A does not reflect a universal
	neural mechanism and that results of fMRI-A experiments will likely
	be paradigm independent in lateral VTC but paradigm dependent in
	medial VTC.},

@article{OberLewa08,
	Annote = {Propose to pit interference based and time based models of forgetting in STM whimsy each other. 

First discuss two classes of time based forgetting models: decay and temporal distinctiveness. 

Decay models assume STM traces decline in strength as time passes causing forgetting. These models generally assume rehearsal can reset or at least boost the strength, reversing decay. Such models intuitively account for effects like word length effects. Use the Norris and page primacy model as example of decay. 

Use simple as an example of temporal distinctiveness. Recall ability of an item depends on it's separation from other itmes along a psychological temporal distance scale. For example the ratio rule says that memorability is a function of the ratio of inter item interval to retention interval. Simple says that the psychologicL time scLe is log compressed so that items presented recently are more distinct from each other than those presented less recently. 

Stress that controling rehearsal is critical when testing time based theories because they can always posit a lack of rehearsal to explain forgetting and posit rehearsal to explain a lack of forgetting. 

They  use SOB as their interference based model. Sob associates items with context and context changes not because of time but because of presentation or recall of new items. Sob has an energy gated encoding mechanism where energy is determined by an items novelty relative to the other presented items. Therefore very dissimilar items get encoded more strongly than dissimilar items. 

Discussbword length effects but point out that word length is confounded with other factors such as phonological complexity which may actually account for much of the effect that originally seemed due to length per se. 

Also discuss the barollet and camos time based resource sharing view wherein rehearsal need not involve sub focalization, but a non vocal attentional refresh mechanism. For example, in complex span tasks both the secondary task and attentional refreshing compete for a processing bottle neck. Criticall if the tbrs view is correct, studies that control rehearsal through articulatory suppression do not really tell us much as attentional rehearsal is not necessarily disrupted by articulation. 

Articulatory suppression is also problematic because the task may produce interference as well as preventing articulation. 

The first experiment used just articulatory suppression while the second used art suppress plus a choice task that should prevent attentional refreshing too. 

Fit all models to the data modifying simple and primacy slightly to get them a better chance of working. 

Primacy assumes that items are encoded and decay with time. It includes a primacy gradient where in each new item is encoded to a maximum level of activation but that maximal level decreases across serial positions, that is, early items are encoded with a higher activation level. Recall is simply a function of activation level - the highest activated items are recalled first, then suppressed, allowing the next highest to be recalled. Recall errors arise form two sources. A recall threshold that prevents really weak items from getting recalled and noise in the activation levels such that later items occasionally have higher activation than earlier items and thus ocassionallly get recalled First producing order errors. 

Decay is reversed by rehearsal. Rehearsal takes the form of a covert retrieval. Retrieval basically sets up a new primacy gradient wherein the items recalled during the covert retrieval are reencoded, the old copy of the list is disbarred and the next item is encoded into the new copy. Rehearsal takes place between item presentations only if the average time between items allows for complete rehearsal of the whole list. 

Two changes were made to the original model. First rehearsal is not a perfect - order errors can be made and these propagate throug the rest of the list as the list is reencoded in the same order it was recalled during the rehearsal. Second, articulatory suppression does not totally prevent recall, rather a parameter is added to control the probability of a rehearsal during any interval long enough to allow it. 

However enve the the modifications the model tends to under predict the effect of adding articulatory suppression between items both at encoding and retrieval and tends to over predict the difference between 1 versus 3 repetitions of the articulatory suppression, especially at retrieval. 

Move onto simple. Suggest that simple has three core assumptions. One that items are represented by position within a (possibly) multidemisonal psychological space. Two, Similarity between items declines with the d...},

@article{HassWybl97,
	Annote = {Free recall and recognition are simulated in a network model of the
	hippocampal formation, incorporating simplified simulations of neurons,
	synaptic connections, and the effects of acetylcholine. Simulations
	focus on modeling the effects of the acetylcholine receptor blocker
	scopolamine on human memory. Systemic administration of scopolamine
	is modeled by blockade of the cellular effects of acetylcholine in
	the model, resulting in memory impairments replicating data from
	studies on human subjects. This blockade of cholinergic effects impairs
	the encoding of new input patterns (as measured by delayed free recall),
	but does not impair the delayed free recall of input patterns learned
	before the blockade. The impairment is selective to the free recall
	but not the recognition of items encoded under the influence of scopolamine.
	In the model, scopolamine blocks strengthening of recurrent connections
	in region CA3 to form attractor states for new items (encoding impaired)
	but allows recurrent excitation to drive the network into previously
	stored attractor states (retrieval spared). Neuron populations representing
	items (individual words) have weaker recurrent connections than neuron
	populations representing experimental context. When scopolamine further
	weakens the strength of recurrent connections it selectively prevents
	the subsequent reactivation of item attractor states by context input
	(impaired free recall) without impairing the subsequent reactivation
	of context attractor states by item input (spared recognition). This
	asymmetry in the strength of attractor states also allows simulation
	of the list-strength effect for free recall but not recognition.
	Simulation of a paired associate learning paradigm predicts that
	scopolamine should greatly enhance proactive interference due to
	retrieval of previously encoded associations during storage of new
	associations.},

	Abstract = {Human area V1 offers an excellent opportunity to study, using
 functional MRI, a range of properties in a specific cortical visual
 area, whose borders are defined objectively and convergently by
 retinotopic criteria. The retinotopy in V1 (also known as primary
 visual cortex, striate cortex, or Brodmann's area 17) was defined in
 each subject by using both stationary and phase-encoded polar
 coordinate stimuli. Data from V1 and neighboring retinotopic areas were
 displayed on flattened cortical maps. In additional tests we revealed
 the paired cortical representations of the monocular ``blind
 spot.'' We also activated area V1 preferentially (relative to other
 extrastriate areas) by presenting radial gratings alternating between
 6% and 100% contrast. Finally, we showed evidence for orientation
 selectivity in V1 by measuring transient functional MRI increases
 produced at the change in response to gratings of differing
 orientations. By systematically varying the orientations presented, we
 were able to measure the bandwidth of the orientation
 ``transients'' (45$\,^{\circ}$).},

	Abstract = {We review lesion and neuroimaging evidence on the role of the hippocampus,
	and other structures, in retention and retrieval of recent and remote
	memories. We examine episodic, semantic and spatial memory, and show
	that important distinctions exist among different types of these
	memories and the structures that mediate them. We argue that retention
	and retrieval of detailed, vivid autobiographical memories depend
	on the hippocampal system no matter how long ago they were acquired.
	Semantic memories, on the other hand, benefit from hippocampal contribution
	for some time before they can be retrieved independently of the hippocampus.
	Even semantic memories, however, can have episodic elements associated
	with them that continue to depend on the hippocampus. Likewise, we
	distinguish between experientially detailed spatial memories (akin
	to episodic memory) and more schematic memories (akin to semantic
	memory) that are sufficient for navigation but not for re-experiencing
	the environment in which they were acquired. Like their episodic
	and semantic counterparts, the former type of spatial memory is dependent
	on the hippocampus no matter how long ago it was acquired, whereas
	the latter can survive independently of the hippocampus and is represented
	in extra-hippocampal structures. In short, the evidence reviewed
	suggests strongly that the function of the hippocampus (and possibly
	that of related limbic structures) is to help encode, retain, and
	retrieve experiences, no matter how long ago the events comprising
	the experience occurred, and no matter whether the memories are episodic
	or spatial. We conclude that the evidence favours a multiple trace
	theory (MTT) of memory over two other models: (1) traditional consolidation
	models which posit that the hippocampus is a time-limited memory
	structure for all forms of memory; and (2) versions of cognitive
	map theory which posit that the hippocampus is needed for representing
	all forms of allocentric space in memory.},

@article{BuckEtal98b,
	Abstract = {In a companion paper (R. L. Buckner et al., 1998, NeuroImage 7, 151-162)
	we used fMRI to identify brain areas activated by episodic memory
	retrieval. Prefrontal areas were shown to differentiate component
	processes related to retrieval success and retrieval effort in block-designed
	paradigms. Importantly, a right anterior prefrontal area was most
	active during task blocks involving greatest retrieval success, consistent
	with an earlier PET study by M. D. Rugg et al. (1996, Brain 119,
	2073-2083). However, manipulation of these variables within the context
	of blocked trials confounds differences related to varying levels
	of retrieval success with potential shifts in subjects' strategies
	due to changes in the probability of target events across blocks.
	To test more rigorously the hypothesis that certain areas are directly
	related to retrieval success, we adopted recently developed procedures
	for event-related fMRI. Fourteen subjects studied words under deep
	encoding and were then tested in a mixed trial paradigm where old
	and new words were randomly presented. This recognition testing procedure
	activated similar areas to the blocked trial paradigm, with all areas
	showing similar levels of activation across old and new items. Of
	critical importance, significant activation was detected in right
	anterior prefrontal cortex for new items when subjects correctly
	indicated they were new (correct rejections). These findings go against
	the retrieval success hypothesis as formally proposed and provide
	an important constraint for interpretation of this region's role
	in episodic retrieval. Furthermore, anterior prefrontal activation
	was found to occur late, relative to other brain areas, suggesting
	that it may be involved in retrieval verification or monitoring processes
	or perhaps even in anticipation of subsequent trial events (although
	an alternative possibility, that the late onset is mediated by a
	late vascular response, cannot be ruled out). These findings and
	their relation to the results obtained in the companion blocked-trial
	paradigm are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Recognition decisions can be based on familiarity, the sense that
	an item was encountered previously (item memory), and on recollection,
	the conscious recovery of contextual information surrounding a previous
	encounter with the item (e.g., source memory). Recognition with recollection
	is thought to depend on multiple mechanisms, including prefrontal
	``control'' processes that guide retrieval and recapitulation mechanisms
	that reactivate posterior neocortical representations that were present
	at encoding. However, uncertainty remains regarding the precise nature
	of prefrontal contributions to recollection and the selectivity of
	recapitulation to veridical recollection. The present event-related
	functional magnetic resonance imaging study sought to examine whether
	regions showing ``old-new'' effects support processes sensitive to
	recollection success or recollection attempt and whether recapitulation
	of neocortical representations emerge during veridical recollection
	as well as during false recognition (i.e., false alarms) or whether
	false recognition resembles familiarity-based responding. Results
	revealed that multiple left prefrontal cortical regions were engaged
	during attempts to recollect previous contextual (source) details,
	regardless of the nature of the to-be-recollected details and of
	source recollection outcome (successful vs unsuccessful). Recapitulation
	effects were observed in regions sensitive to the encoding task,
	suggesting that veridical recollection entails the reactivation of
	processes or representations present during encoding. Importantly,
	in contrast to leading models of recognition memory, false alarms
	also appeared to be based partially on recollection, as revealed
	through false recapitulation effects. Implications for neural and
	cognitive models of recognition are considered.},

	Abstract = {Gain modulation is a prominent feature of neuronal activity recorded
	in behaving animals, but the mechanism by which it occurs is unknown.
	By introducing a barrage of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances
	that mimics conditions encountered in vivo into pyramidal neurons
	in slices of rat somatosensory cortex, we show that the gain of a
	neuronal response to excitatory drive can be modulated by varying
	the level of ``background'' synaptic input. Simultaneously increasing
	both excitatory and inhibitory background firing rates in a balanced
	manner results in a divisive gain modulation of the neuronal response
	without appreciable signal-independent increases in firing rate or
	spike-train variability. These results suggest that, within active
	cortical circuits, the overall level of synaptic input to a neuron
	acts as a gain control signal that modulates responsiveness to excitatory
	drive.},

	Abstract = {Our capacity to process and respond behaviourally to multiple incoming
	stimuli is very limited. To optimize the use of this limited capacity,
	attentional mechanisms give priority to behaviourally relevant stimuli
	at the expense of irrelevant distractors. In visual areas, attended
	stimuli induce enhanced responses and an improved synchronization
	of rhythmic neuronal activity in the gamma frequency band (40-70
	Hz). Both effects probably improve the neuronal signalling of attended
	stimuli within and among brain areas. Attention also results in improved
	behavioural performance and shortened reaction times. However, it
	is not known how reaction times are related to either response strength
	or gamma-band synchronization in visual areas. Here we show that
	behavioural response times to a stimulus change can be predicted
	specifically by the degree of gamma-band synchronization among those
	neurons in monkey visual area V4 that are activated by the behaviourally
	relevant stimulus. When there are two visual stimuli and monkeys
	have to detect a change in one stimulus while ignoring the other,
	their reactions are fastest when the relevant stimulus induces strong
	gamma-band synchronization before and after the change in stimulus.
	This enhanced gamma-band synchronization is also followed by shorter
	neuronal response latencies on the fast trials. Conversely, the monkeys'
	reactions are slowest when gamma-band synchronization is high in
	response to the irrelevant distractor. Thus, enhanced neuronal gamma-band
	synchronization and shortened neuronal response latencies to an attended
	stimulus seem to have direct effects on visually triggered behaviour,
	reflecting an early neuronal correlate of efficient visuo-motor integration.},

	Abstract = {The effects of gaze eccentricity on the steering of an automobile were studied. Drivers performed an attention task while attempting to drive down the middle of a straight road in a simulation. Steering was biased in the direction of fixation, and deviation from the center of the road was proportional to the gaze direction until saturation at approximately 15 degrees gaze-angle from straight ahead. This effect remains when the position of the head was controlled and a reverse-steering task was used. Furthermore, the effect was not dependent on speed but reversed when the forward movement of the driver was removed from the simulation. Thus, small deviations in a driver's gaze can lead to significant impairments of the ability to drive a straight course.},

@article{ORei01,
	Abstract = {Computational models in cognitive neuroscience should ideally use
	biological properties and powerful computational principles to produce
	behavior consistent with psychological findings. Error-driven backpropagation
	is computationally powerful and has proven useful for modeling a
	range of psychological data but is not biologically plausible. Several
	approaches to implementing backpropagation in a biologically plausible
	fashion converge on the idea of using bidirectional activation propagation
	in interactive networks to convey error signals. This article demonstrates
	two main points about these error-driven interactive networks: (1)
	they generalize poorly due to attractor dynamics that interfere with
	the network's ability to produce novel combinatorial representations
	systematically in response to novel inputs, and (2) this generalization
	problem can be remedied by adding two widely used mechanistic principles,
	inhibitory competition and Hebbian learning, that can be independently
	motivated for a variety of biological, psychological, and computational
	reasons. Simulations using the Leabra algorithm, which combines the
	generalized recirculation (GeneRec), biologically plausible, error-driven
	learning algorithm with inhibitory competition and Hebbian learning,
	show that these mechanisms can result in good generalization in interactive
	networks. These results support the general conclusion that cognitive
	neuroscience models that incorporate the core mechanistic principles
	of interactivity, inhibitory competition, and error-driven and Hebbian
	learning satisfy a wider range of biological, psychological, and
	computational constraints than models employing a subset of these
	principles.},

	power in the high gamma (80 to 150 hertz) band of the electrocorticogram,
	with stronger modulation occurring at higher theta amplitudes. Furthermore,
	different behavioral tasks evoke distinct patterns of theta/high
	gamma coupling across the cortex. The results indicate that transient
	coupling between low- and high-frequency brain rhythms coordinates
	activity in distributed cortical areas, providing a mechanism for
	effective communication during cognitive processing in humans.},

	Abstract = {Hippocampal CA3 cells were recorded in male Long-Evans rats that explored
	a square recording chamber. Three of the 4 chamber walls held a rectangular
	cue card, each of different size. Rotating the set of cue cards rotated
	the location of the place fields. Place fields were common close
	to the walls of the recording chamber, particularly the walls with
	cues. When single cues were removed, the spatial information content
	decreased but returned to baseline levels when the cue was replaced.
	When a cue near a place field was removed, the place field firing
	rate and area decreased; when a distant cue was removed, firing rate
	and area increased. Thus, removing single visual cues predictably
	and reversibly altered hippocampal place fields. Together, the results
	suggest that hippocampal neurons may optimize the encoding of visual
	information and are consistent with a distance-encoding hypothesis
	of CA3 network function.},

	Abstract = {Encoding and recall of memory sequences is an important process. Memory
	encoding is thought to occur by long-term potentiation (LTP) in the
	hippocampus; however, it remains unclear how LTP, which has a time
	window for induction of approximately 100 ms, could encode the linkage
	between sequential items that arrive with a temporal separation >100
	ms. Here, we argue that LTP can underlie the learning of such memory
	sequences, provided the input to the hippocampus is from a cortical
	multi-item working memory buffer in which theta and gamma oscillations
	have an important role. In such a buffer, memory items that occurred
	seconds apart are represented with a temporal separation of 20-30
	ms, thereby bringing them within the LTP window. The physiological
	and behavioral evidence for such a buffer will be reviewed.},

	Abstract = {Current models of verbal short-term memory (STM) propose various mechanisms
	for serial order. These include a gradient of activation over items,
	associations between items, and associations between items and their
	positions relative to the start or end of a sequence. We compared
	models using a variant of Hebb's procedure in which immediate serial
	recall of a sequence improves if the sequence is presented more than
	once. However, instead of repeating a complete sequence, we repeated
	different aspects of serial order information common to training
	lists and a subsequent test list. In Experiment 1, training lists
	repeated all the item-item pairings in the test list, with or without
	the position-item pairings in the test list. Substantial learning
	relative to a control condition was observed only when training lists
	repeated item-item pairs with position-item pairs, and position was
	defined relative to the start rather than end of a sequence. Experiment
	2 attempted to analyse the basis of this learning effect further
	by repeating fragments of the test list during training, where fragments
	consisted of either isolated position-item pairings or clusters of
	both position-item and item-item pairings. Repetition of sequence
	fragments led to only weak learning effects. However, where learning
	was observed it was for specific position-item pairings. We conclude
	that positional cues play an important role in the coding of serial
	order in memory but that the information required to learn a sequence
	goes beyond position-item associations. We suggest that whereas STM
	for a novel sequence is based on positional cues, learning a sequence
	involves the development of some additional representation of the
	sequence as a whole.},

	Van Orden et al. pres ented evidence that 'purposive behavior originates

	that Van Orden et al.'s analyses do not test their hypotheses. Further,
	the authors argue that a confirmation of Van Orden et al.'s hypotheses
	would not have constituted firm evidence in support of their f ramework.
	Finally, the absence of a specific model for how self-organized critic
	ality produces the observed behavior makes it very difficult to derive

@article{SummEtal11,
	Abstract = {Repetitions of a sensory event elicit lower levels of brain activity
	than its initial presentation ("repetition suppression," RS). According
	to one view, RS depends on the biophysics of neuronal discharge,
	and is thus an automatic consequence of stimulus processing ("fatigue"
	model). Another account suggests that RS depends on the statistical
	structure of the environment, and occurs when repeated stimuli are
	less surprising than novel stimuli ("surprise reduction" model).
	In support of the latter view, functional magnetic resonance imaging
	studies have shown that RS is modulated by the local probability
	of repetition. However, single-cell recordings from macaque inferotemporal
	area (IT) have failed to replicate this finding. Here, we recorded
	scalp electroencephalography from human participants viewing pairs
	of faces that repeated (face(1)-face(1)) or alternated (face(1)-face(2)),
	in contexts in which repetitions were expected or unexpected. As
	previously described, event-related potentials in the range of 100-400 ms
	recorded at posterior electrode sites and at the vertex differed
	between repetitions and alternations. Critically, at central electrodes,
	we observed that the difference between repeated and alternating
	stimuli was attenuated when repetitions were unexpected, as predicted
	by the surprise reduction model. These findings demonstrate that
	the modulation of RS by repetition probability is observable using
	direct neural recording methods in human participants, and that it
	occurs relatively late (>300 ms) post-stimulus. Finally, we found
	that theta-band (4-8 Hz) spectral power over central electrodes varied
	with the three-way interaction between of repetition, expectation,
	and the rate of change of the environment, consistent with recent
	reports that frontal theta may be a hallmark of learning processes
	originating in the anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortex.},

	Abstract = {Investigations of the processing of brief visual displays, and the
	explanation of such processing in terms of iconic memory, are reviewed.
	It is concluded that the concept of a pre-categorical sensory memory
	for visual material remains tenable. The ability to report material
	from brief visual displays is seen as depending upon parallel (and
	perhaps unlimited) transfer from iconic memory to a post-categorical
	memory mode, followed by a limited (and perhaps serial) transfer
	to an output stage. Decisions about, or responses to, items can only
	be made when they are in the output stage. Because transfer out of
	the post-categorical mode can be performed on the basis of pre-categorical
	stimulus features, pre-categorical information about items in the
	post-categorical mode must be accessible. One way in which this would
	be possible is if the transfer of an item into the post-categorical
	mode takes the form of the creation, to represent the item, of a
	temporary file of information including both pre-categorical and
	post-categorical features of the item. Any such feature can be used
	as the basis for selecting the item for transfer from the post-categorical
	mode to the output stage, for subsequent decision or report.},

	of schizophrenia. These impairments have been attributed either to
	global cortical dysfunction or to perturbations of specific components
	associated with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), hippocampus
	and cerebellum. Here, we used positron emission tomography (PET)
	to dissociate activations in DLPFC and hippocampus during verbal
	episodic memory retrieval. We found reduced hippocampal activation
	during conscious recollection of studied words, but robust activation
	of the DLPFC during the effort to retrieve poorly encoded material
	in schizophrenic patients. This finding provides the first evidence

	Abstract = {The article reports an investigation of implicit and explicit memory
	for novel, visual patterns. Implicit memory was assessed by a speeded
	perception task, and explicit memory by a four-alternative, forced-choice
	recognition task. Tests were given either immediately after testing
	or 7 days later. The results suggest that a single exposure of a
	novel, nonverbal stimulus is sufficient to establish a representation
	in memory that is capable of supporting long-lived perceptual priming.
	In contrast, recognition memory showed significant loss over the
	same delay. Performance measures in the two tasks showed stochastic
	independence on the first trial after a single exposure to each pattern.
	Finally, a specific occurrence of a previously studied item could
	be retrieved from explicit memory but did not affect the accuracy
	of perception in the implicit memory test. The results extend the
	domain of experimental dissociations between explicit and implicit
	memory to include novel, nonverbal stimuli.},

	Correspondingly, neuronal responses to stimuli became larger and

Correlated the size of each participant's RIF effect (how much forgetting) with span and found a positive correlation: participants with higher spans showed more forgetting.
Significant Because: This reflects my personal biases as RIF was important in my thesis work. But there has been a big debate over whether RIF is due to active suppression via some inhibitory mechanism or due to some sort of interference/blocking effect. The inhibition account predicts a positive correlation between memory span and RIF whereas the interference account predicts a negative correlation. This is actually one of several studies in the past year or so with similar findings, but I think this one is significant as it made me feel that the weight of evidence from a variety of sources is now strong enough to be fairly confident in the suppression account. That is, I think this paper may help move the debate beyond a 'stalemate' that has lasted for years.},

	Abstract = {It has been hypothesized that visual objects could be represented
	in the brain by a distributed cell assembly synchronized on an oscillatory
	mode in the gamma-band (20-80 Hz). If this hypothesis is correct,
	then oscillatory gamma-band activity should appear in any task requiring
	the activation of an object representation, and in particular when
	an object representation is held active in short-term memory: sustained
	gamma-band activity is thus expected during the delay of a delayed-matching-to-sample
	task. EEG was recorded while subjects performed such a task. Induced
	(e.g., appearing with a jitter in latency from one trial to the next)
	gamma-band activity was observed during the delay. In a control task,
	in which no memorization was required, this activity disappeared.
	Furthermore, this gamma-band activity during the rehearsal of the
	first stimulus representation in short-term memory peaked at both
	occipitotemporal and frontal electrodes. This topography fits with
	the idea of a synchronized cortical network centered on prefrontal
	and ventral visual areas. Activities in the alpha band, in the 15-20
	Hz band, and in the averaged evoked potential were also analyzed.
	The gamma-band activity during the delay can be distinguished from
	all of these other components of the response, on the basis of either
	its variations or its topography. It thus seems to be a specific
	functional component of the response that could correspond to the
	rehearsal of an object representation in short-term memory.},

Before critical target trials there were one or four prime trials in which particiapts read/generated catergory-exemplar pairs from the same category as the critical targets, or control items.

When the prime items were read, facilation was found for the RT to name/generate the critical items (i.e., the same category primes lead to faster RTs on the target items than did the control primes).

When the primes were generated, there was no benifit for target RTs for the read or generate target condition, except for the one prime generate target condition, which showed facilatiation.

Critically, for the generate target condition, RTs generating four primes lead to slower RTs for targets than did generating one prime. They take this as evidence that multiple generations produces category specific inhibition. },

	encode the temporal properties of recent events and/or to associate
	information across time. The present investigation tested this postulation
	by manipulating the recency effect which is theorized to be caused
	by the encoding of temporal information. The continual-distractor
	paradigm was used to vary the temporal properties of recently presented
	lists. Amnesics' recall responded normally to the temporal manipulations
	in lists ranging from 18-54 s. In contrast, overall recall was impaired
	compared to normals in all conditions and across all positions, including
	the final position. These findings dissociate memory for temporal
	information from overall levels of recall. They suggest that the
	amnesic patient's memory deficit is not caused by an inability to

	Abstract = {fMRI and EEG are complimentary methods for the analysis of brain activity
	since each method has its strength where the other one has limits:
	The spatial resolution is thus in the range of millimeters with fMRI
	and the time resolution is in the range of milliseconds with EEG.
	For a comprehensive understanding of brain activity in target detection,
	nine healthy subjects (age 24.2 +/- 2.9) were investigated with simultaneous
	EEG (27 electrodes) and fMRI using an auditory oddball paradigm.
	As a first step, event-related potentials, measured inside the scanner,
	have been compared with the potentials recorded in a directly preceding
	session in front of the scanner. Attenuated amplitudes were found
	inside the scanner for the earlier N1/P2 component but not for the
	late P300 component. Second, an independent analysis of the localizations
	of the fMRI activations and the current source density as revealed
	by low resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) has been done.
	Concordant activations were found in most regions, including the
	temporoparietal junction (TPJ), the supplementary motor area (SMA)/anterior
	cingulate cortex (ACC), the insula, and the middle frontal gyrus,
	with a mean Euclidean distance of 16.0 +/- 6.6 mm between the BOLD
	centers of gravity and the LORETA-maxima. Finally, a time-course
	analysis based on the current source density maxima was done. It
	revealed different time-course patterns in the left and right hemisphere
	with earlier activations in frontal and parietal regions in the right
	hemisphere. The results suggest that the combination of EEG and fMRI
	permits an improved understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics
	of brain activity.},

	Abstract = {Attention increases the contrast gain of V4 neurons, causing them
	to respond to an attended stimulus as though its contrast had increased.
	When multiple stimuli appear within a neuron's receptive field (RF),
	the neuron responds primarily to the attended stimulus. This suggests
	that cortical cells may be ``hard wired'' to respond preferentially
	to the highest-contrast stimulus in their RF, and neural systems
	for attention capitalize on this mechanism by dynamically increasing
	the effective contrast of the stimulus that is task relevant. To
	test this, we varied the relative contrast of two stimuli within
	the recorded neurons' RFs, while the monkeys attended away to another
	location. Increasing the physical contrast of one stimulus caused
	V4 neurons to respond preferentially to that stimulus and reduced
	their responses to competing stimuli. When attention was directed
	to the lower-contrast stimulus, it partially overcame the influence
	of a competing, higher-contrast stimulus.},

	Abstract = {Mounting behavioral evidence in humans supports the claim that sleep
	leads to improvements in recently acquired, nondeclarative memories.
	Examples include motor-sequence learning; visual-discrimination learning;
	and perceptual learning of a synthetic language. In contrast, there
	are limited human data supporting a benefit of sleep for declarative
	(hippocampus-mediated) memory in humans (for review, see). This is
	particularly surprising given that animal models (e.g.,) and neuroimaging
	studies (e.g.,) predict that sleep facilitates hippocampus-based
	memory consolidation. We hypothesized that we could unmask the benefits
	of sleep by challenging the declarative memory system with competing
	information (interference). This is the first study to demonstrate
	that sleep protects declarative memories from subsequent associative
	interference, and it has important implications for understanding
	the neurobiology of memory consolidation.},

	Abstract = {Behavioral studies of visual recognition memory indicate that old/new decisions reflect both the similarity of the probe to the studied items (probe-item similarity) and the similarities among the studied items themselves (list homogeneity). Recording intracranial electroencephalography from 1,155 electrodes across 15 patients, we examined the oscillatory correlates of probe-item similarity and homogeneity effects in short-term recognition memory for synthetic faces. Frontal areas show increases in low-frequency oscillations with both probe-item and item-item similarity, whereas temporal lobe areas show distinct oscillatory correlates for probe-item similarity and homogeneity in the gamma band. We discuss these frontal low-frequency effects and the dissociation in the temporal lobe in terms of recent computational models of visual recognition memory.},

@article{TurnEngl89,
	Annote = {ME: if working memory is broken down into storage and processing and diffs in storage reflect diffs in processing efficency i.e., storage is limited only insofar as processing consumes working memory capacity, why then are there individual differences in simple digit and word span tasks and why do they not correlate with reading comprehension?

In exp two they varied the difficulty of the tasks to show that the extent to which the task allowed the use of mem stratigies effected the correlation between span and reading comp

In experiment 1 they used 4 versions of complex span tasks: both the reading and operation span with either of two typed of targets: words or digits. 

It was found that the versions using words correlated with reading ability better than the versions using digits but that there was little difference between ospan and rspan. Similar patterns were seen in span/vsat and span/qsat corrs with the digit versions not even reaching sig for vsat

In experiment 2 they varied the difficulty of the processing component of both ospand and vspan. General capacity theory would predict inverted ushaped funcitions for the corr between span/ability for both types of span (low when too easy, high when moderate, and low when too hard because of compression of range or subjects giving up on one or the other component). Resource sharing hypothesis would predict ushaped function only for the domain of processing relevant to the critertion ability (i.e. ushaped function for rspan but not vspan when predicting rading comp) because only if the span measure and the criterion ability share processing domains will there be a relation between span (left over resources after processing) and ability (logic of ushape is same for both theories only diff is prediction of what domains it will be observed for).

Generally the predictions of the gen capacity hypothesis regarding effect of difficulty were born out, though some comparisons failed to reach sig (particurarly for VSAT as opposed to nelson-denny corrs) probably due to low power due to small n

	Abstract = {We propose a new hypothesis concerning the lateralization of prefrontal
	cortex (PFC) activity during verbal episodic memory retrieval. The
	hypothesis states that the left PFC is differentially more involved
	in semantically guided information production than is the right PFC,
	and that the right PFC is differentially more involved in monitoring
	and verification than is the left PFC. This ``production-monitoring
	hypothesis'' differs from the existing ``systematic-heuristic hypothesis,''
	which proposes that the left PFC is primarily involved in systematic
	retrieval operations, and the right PFC in heuristic retrieval operations.
	To compare the two hypotheses, we measured PFC activity using positron
	emission tomography (PET) during the performance of four episodic
	retrieval tasks: stem cued recall, associative cued recall, context
	recognition (source memory), and item recognition. Recall tasks emphasized
	production processes, whereas recognition tasks emphasized monitoring
	processes. Stem cued recall and context-recognition tasks underscored
	systematic operations, whereas associative cued recall and item-recognition
	tasks underscored heuristic operations. Consistent with the production-monitoring
	hypothesis, the left PFC was more activated for recall than for recognition
	tasks and the right PFC was more activated for recognition than for
	recall tasks. Inconsistent with the systematic-heuristic hypothesis,
	the left PFC was more activated for heuristic than for systematic
	tasks and the right PFC showed the converse result. Additionally,
	the study yielded activation differences outside the PFC. In agreement
	with a previous recall/recognition PET study, anterior cingulate,
	cerebellar, and striatal regions were more activated for recall than
	for recognition tasks, and the converse occurred for posterior parietal
	regions. A right medial temporal lobe region was more activated for
	stem cued recall and context recognition than for associative cued
	recall and item recognition, possibly reflecting perceptual integration.
	In sum, the results provide evidence for the production-monitoring
	hypothesis and clarify the role of different brain regions typically
	activated in PET and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
	studies of episodic retrieval.},

	Abstract = {The major current theory relating brain mechanisms in prefrontal cortex
	(PFC) to memory for discrete events (episodic memory) emphasizes
	the role of right PFC during retrieval. Using event-related fMRI,
	we found both right and left PFC activity during episodic remembering,
	but only the left PFC activity was related to the amount of episodic
	detail required at test. We suggest that right PFC subserves relatively
	simple, heuristic, cognitive processes and that left PFC is recruited
	for more reflectively demanding, systematic, processes. Episodic
	remembering often requires such systematic processes and, under those
	circumstances, recruits left, as well as right, PFC.},

@article{PascEtal94,
	Abstract = {This paper presents a new method for localizing the electric activity
	in the brain based on multichannel surface EEG recordings. In contrast
	to the models presented up to now the new method does not assume
	a limited number of dipolar point sources nor a distribution on a
	given known surface, but directly computes a current distribution
	throughout the full brain volume. In order to find a unique solution
	for the 3-dimensional distribution among the infinite set of different
	possible solutions, the method assumes that neighboring neurons are
	simultaneously and synchronously activated. The basic assumption
	rests on evidence from single cell recordings in the brain that demonstrates
	strong synchronization of adjacent neurons. In view of this physiological
	consideration the computational task is to select the smoothest of
	all possible 3-dimensional current distributions, a task that is
	a common procedure in generalized signal processing. The result is
	a true 3-dimensional tomography with the characteristic that localization
	is preserved with a certain amount of dispersion, i.e., it has a
	relatively low spatial resolution. The new method, which we call
	Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA) is illustrated
	with two different sets of evoked potential data, the first showing
	the tomography of the P100 component to checkerboard stimulation

	Abstract = {Both aging and Alzheimer's disease target the hippocampal formation
	and can result in mild to devastating memory impairment depending
	on the severity of the condition. Understanding the normal mnemonic
	functions of the hippocampus and related structures of the medial
	temporal lobe is the first step toward the development of diagnostics
	and treatments designed to ameliorate these potentially devastating
	age-related memory deficits. Here I describe findings from behavioral
	neurophysiological studies in which we have investigated the patterns
	of dynamic neural activity seen in the macaque monkey hippocampus
	during the acquisition of new associative memories. We report that
	hippocampal neurons signal the formation of new associations with
	dramatic changes in their firing rate. Because these learning-related
	signals can occur just before behavioral learning is expressed, this
	suggests that these signals play a role in driving the learning process.
	Implications of these findings for understanding the memory deficits
	associated with aging and Alzheimer's disease are discussed.},

	Abstract = {In a novel choice attention-gating paradigm, observers monitor a stream
	of 3 x 3 letter arrays until a tonal cue directs them to report 1
	row. Analyses of the particular arrays from which reported letters
	are chosen and of the joint probabilities of reporting pairs of letters
	are used to derive a theory of attention dynamics. An attention window
	opens 0.15 s following a cue to attend to a location, remains open
	(minimally) 0.2 s, and admits information simultaneously from all
	the newly attended locations. The window dynamics are independent
	of the distance moved. The theory accounts for about 90\% of the
	variance from the over 400 data points obtained from each of the
	observers in the 3 experiments reported here. With minor elaborations,
	it applies to all the principal paradigms used to study the dynamics
	of visual spatial attention.},

@article{LachEtal99,
	Annote = {This article presents, for the first time, a practical method for
	the direct quantification of frequency-specific synchronization (i.e.,
	transient phase-locking) between two neuroelectric signals. The motivation
	for its development is to be able to examine the role of neural synchronies
	as a putative mechanism for long-range neural integration during
	cognitive tasks. The method, called phase-locking statistics (PLS),
	measures the significance of the phase covariance between two signals
	with a reasonable time-resolution (<100 ms). Unlike the more traditional
	method of spectral coherence, PLS separates the phase and amplitude
	components and can be directly interpreted in the framework of neural
	integration. To validate synchrony values against background fluctuations,
	PLS uses surrogate data and thus makes no a priori assumptions on
	the nature of the experimental data. We also apply PLS to investigate
	intracortical recordings from an epileptic patient performing a visual
	discrimination task. We find large-scale synchronies in the gamma
	band (45 Hz), e.g., between hippocampus and frontal gyrus, and local
	synchronies, within a limbic region, a few cm apart. We argue that
	whereas long-scale effects do reflect cognitive processing, short-scale
	synchronies are likely to be due to volume conduction. We discuss
	ways to separate such conduction effects from true signal synchrony.},

	Annote = {Working memory is an emergent property of neuronal networks, but
	its cellular basis remains elusive. Recent data show that principal
	neurons of the entorhinal cortex display persistent firing at graded
	firing rates that can be shifted up or down in response to brief
	excitatory or inhibitory stimuli. Here, we present a model of a potential
	mechanism for graded firing. Our multicompartmental model provides
	stable plateau firing generated by a nonspecific calcium-sensitive
	cationic (CAN) current. Sustained firing is insensitive to small
	variations in Ca2+ concentration in a neutral zone. However, both
	high and low Ca2+ levels alter firing rates. Specifically, increases
	in persistent firing rate are triggered only during high levels of
	calcium, while decreases in rate occur in the presence of low levels
	of calcium. The model is consistent with detailed experimental observations
	and provides a mechanism for maintenance of memory-related activity
	in individual neurons.},

	Abstract = {Discusses the use of signal detection theory as a model of the decision
	process in memory in terms of the problems of identification and
	testing. Identification refers to the matching of elements of the
	formal theory with constructs constituting a theory of memory. A
	number of issues are raised concerning the identification of the
	sensory continuum, the decision axis, and the distinction between
	signal and noise. The use of detection theory is not a theoretically
	neutral method of dealing with response bias; the validity of its
	use and the manner of its application depend heavily on certain assumptions
	about the memory system. The form of the operating characteristic
	can be used to test a number of these assumptions but such tests
	are relatively insensitive. The use of detection theory in the analysis
	of cued-recall data poses additional problems and is meaningful in
	the context of some, but not all, theories of recall.},

	Abstract = {Some forms of memory have been shown to depend on a system of medial
	temporal lobe structures that includes the hippocampus and the adjacent
	cortical areas (entorhinal, perirhinal, and parahippocampal cortex).
	The role of this system is only temporary, however, as indicated
	by the fact that, after damage to the medial temporal lobe, recent
	memories are impaired but very remote memories are intact. Here we
	review the evidence that the medial temporal lobe memory system is
	involved in a process of consolidation: memories are initially dependent
	on this system but gradually become established in other areas of
	the brain. We then review some of the ideas that have been proposed
	about the phenomenon of consolidation and suggest a synthesis of
	these views. Finally, we describe a simple neural network model that
	captures some key features of consolidation.},

	Annote = {very low education (~11 years) in the older sample. But the young sample was college students.

could it be that the dual task lowers the number of sucessful retreival practices acomplisehd by older adults? No comparison is given between the E1 and E2 older adult groups, so we can't tell. Despite Storm's wrok showing that it is the atempted retreival per se and not its success/failure that leads to RIF, I'd still be concerend that the dual task may prevent inhibitory processes in some way OTHER than the 'reduced resources' account they push here.


The authors interpetation of the reduced RIF effect under dual tasks doesn't sit well with a closer eximination of the hit/false alarm rates in Table 2 -{\&}gt; there seems to be some effect on false alarms{\ldots} need to take a closer look at the table to wrap my head arround it.

	Abstract = {Episodic recognition can be based on recollection of contextual details,
	on a sense of recent encounter, or some combination of the two. According
	to several cognitive models, selectively attending to these distinct
	aspects of memory may require different retrieval orientations and
	result in different neural responses depending upon whether or not
	retrieval is successful. Using event-related fMRI, we examined retrieval
	orientation by having subjects discriminate between two test words
	in one of two manners. During source recollection, they selected
	the member of the pair previously associated with a particular encoding
	task. In contrast, recency judgment required selection of the most
	recently encountered item of the pair, regardless of how it had been
	encoded. Furthermore, successful and unsuccessful trials within each
	retrieval task were contrasted to determine whether retrieval success
	effects occurred in overlapping or dissimilar neural populations
	compared to those associated with each retrieval orientation. The
	results revealed distinct lateral prefrontal and parietal activations
	that distinguished attempted source recollection from judgments of
	relative recency; these orientation effects were largely independent
	of retrieval success. In contrast, medial temporal lobe structures
	(hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus) were differentially more
	active during successful recollection of encoding context, showing
	similar reduced responses during failed source recollection and judgments
	of recency. These results indicate that different memory orientations
	recruit distinct prefrontal and parietal networks and that the recovery
	of episodic context is associated with the hippocampus and surrounding
	medial temporal cortices.},

	memory strength remain poorly specified. Here, functional MRI (fMRI)

	correlates of graded memory strength in the human brain, focusing
	on medial temporal cortex. fMRI revealed a decrease in medial temporal
	cortical activation that tracked parametric levels of perceived memory
	strength. Anatomically constrained MEG current estimates revealed
	that strength-dependent signal reductions onset within 150-300 ms.
	Memory strength appears to be rapidly signaled by medial temporal

	Annote = {Review of metacognition in older adults and if/how it can help with aspects of cognitive decline.

Talk about metacognition as abilities to monitor current cognition and use the results of monitoring to control it. For example, a student studying can use metacognition to monitor what aspects of the material are well learned and poorly learned and then direct more attention to the aspects that need it.

The suggestion is that if older adults have intact metacognitive abilities they may be able to leverage them to compensate for declines in cognitive abilities such as encoding - by focusing on those things that metacognition tells them are less well learned.

Discuss judgments of learning as one major method of studying metacognition.

Distinguish between immediate JOLs and delated JOLs. Immediate JOLs (e.g., judging if the the paired associate tick-spoon will be recalled later immediately after learning it) are said to rely on the fluency with which the information was processed during study. Delated JOLs (e.g., after a long study list ask how likely the tick-____ pair is to be recalled on a later test), these are said to rely on retrieval processes (e.g., if I can retrieve it now, I probably will be able to later). ME: theses, especially delayed judgments, don't really seem to be meta- but just applying regular cognition in different ways... maybe I will be convinced later that there is something special...


Another method is feeling of knowing judgments. That is, judging wether or not you know the answer to a question you currently cannot answer (e.g., I may know I know the name of the movie I saw last week even if I currently cannot produce it).

regardless of the measure of metacognition, you can measure its accuracy, or resolution, by comparing the judgments to later performance on an actual memory test (e.g., are the items that got high feeling of knowing judgments more likely to be recognized on a later recognition test). The usual method, apparently, is to calculate a within person correlation between the memory judgment for a given item and performance on that item on an actual memory test.


Older and younger adults both tend to have reasonably hight resolution judgments and there is little age difference.

Delayed JOLs seem to be better than immediate, perhaps because the are essentially a recall episode.

Also evidence that various manipulations or variables (such as relatedness of words in paired associates, or use of strategies such as imagery) have equal effects on old and young.

one exception seems to be that older adults have lower resolution immediate JOLs for old/new recognition judgments

in terms of feeling of knowing (FOK) judgments, olders do no seem to have trouble with general knowledge questions, but do seem to have lower resolution FOKs for new episodic memories from lab tests.

Also, older adults often have less accurate confidence rating in recognition experiments (e.g., high confidence false alarms).

They suggest that age differences in FOKs and confidence judgments may reflect underlying differences in the quality of memory traces that are being evaluated rather than the metacognitive processes - that is, accurate memory judgment depends on having an accurate memory. I'm not sure what to think of it, at one level it seems to conflate memory and metamemory, making a metamemory judgment simply a memory test under a different name, it is also unclear why the same thing wouldn't impact JOLs, which do not show age differences. But on another level, it could be possible that it is difficult to judge the quality of a poorly encoded memory trace - some kind of non linear function between memory quality and ability to judge quality - you can tell that a good memory is good but you cant tell just how bad a bad memory is?

review some intervention studies and argue that training to use metacognition to focus more attention on things that have not been well learned can help olders. But the detail to too thin to really understand it - sounds more like they are encouraging self testing (i.e., taking advantage of the testing effect).},

	Abstract = {The relationship between electrophysiological and functional magnetic
	resonance imaging (fMRI) signals remains poorly understood. To date,
	studies have required invasive methods and have been limited to single
	functional regions and thus cannot account for possible variations
	across brain regions. Here we present a method that uses fMRI data
	and singe-trial electroencephalography (EEG) analyses to assess the
	spatial and spectral dependencies between the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent
	(BOLD) responses and the noninvasively estimated local field potentials
	(eLFPs) over a wide range of frequencies (0-256 Hz) throughout the
	entire brain volume. This method was applied in a study where human
	subjects completed separate fMRI and EEG sessions while performing
	a passive visual task. Intracranial LFPs were estimated from the
	scalp-recorded data using the ELECTRA source model. We compared statistical
	images from BOLD signals with statistical images of each frequency
	of the eLFPs. In agreement with previous studies in animals, we found
	a significant correspondence between LFP and BOLD statistical images
	in the gamma band (44-78 Hz) within primary visual cortices. In addition,
	significant correspondence was observed at low frequencies (<14 Hz)
	and also at very high frequencies (>100 Hz). Effects within extrastriate
	visual areas showed a different correspondence that not only included
	those frequency ranges observed in primary cortices but also additional
	frequencies. Results therefore suggest that the relationship between
	electrophysiological and hemodynamic signals thus might vary both
	as a function of frequency and anatomical region.},

	differ. The spacing and size of individual fields increase from dorsal

	in their absence, suggesting that grid cells may be part of a generalized,

	Abstract = {Three macaques were trained on a task in which a sequence of single
	visual images was presented serially, and the monkeys signaled whether
	the image was a new or a repeated one. The optic chiasm and splenium
	of the corpus callosum were transected, leaving the anterior commissure
	as the only path for cortical interhemispheric transfer. Images were
	presented to only one eye at a time. Re-presentations of images to
	the same eye were recognized correctly in >95% of trials. A robust
	stimulus-specific adaptation (i.e., a reduced response to a repeated
	image) was seen in the population of single units recorded from inferotemporal
	cortex during these same trials. When an interhemispheric transfer
	was demanded of the animals (i.e., the re-presentation was made to
	the other eye), recognition performance was somewhat reduced, to
	86% correct. Interestingly, in this situation the stimulus-specific
	adaptation disappeared completely. The disappearance occurred regardless
	of whether the transfer direction was from the hemisphere ipsilateral
	to the recording site to the hemisphere contralateral to the recording
	site, or vice versa. Thus, stimulus-specific adaptation in inferotemporal
	cortex units is not required for recognition.},

	Annote = {The symptoms of schizophrenia may be associated with reductions in
	NMDA receptor (NMDAR) function. This is suggested by the psychotomimetic
	effects of NMDA antagonists, the ameliorative effects of NMDAR indirect
	agonists, elevated levels of the NMDA antagonist N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate
	(NAAG) in schizophrenic brain, and findings from recent genetic studies.
	However, the link between reduced NMDAR function and the behavioral
	features of schizophrenics has not been made explicit. Here we present
	a network simulation of hippocampal function, focused on retrieval
	of verbal stimuli in human memory tasks. Specifically, we trained
	a computational model of the hippocampal complex to perform a context-dependent
	paired associate task, a free recall task with category clustering,
	and the transitive inference (TI) task. In this network, direct perforant
	pathway input from entorhinal cortex to region CA1 provides the basis
	for semantic context cueing during initial encoding and retrieval,
	allowing selective retrieval on the basis of category cues. Alterations
	in the magnitude of this direct perforant pathway input to region
	CA1 causes impairments in use of organizational strategies for memory,
	accounting for specific features of memory dysfunction in schizophrenics
	and in normals treated with ketamine. This model provides a theoretical
	link between cellular physiological changes and specific cognitive
	symptoms. As such, it can shed light on the etiology of schizophrenia
	in a fundamental way, and also holds the promise of pointing the
	way to more effective treatments.},

	too soon (ahead of their correct serial position) are recalled more
	slowly than items that are reported too late. We show by simulation
	that these data rule out three of the four representational mechanisms.
	The data support the notion that serial order is represented by a
	primacy gradient that is accompanied by suppression of recalled items.},

	Abstract = {1. Neural activity in the monkey hippocampal formation (HF) was analyzed
	during a spatial moving task in which the monkey was guided by auditory
	and visual cues and when stimuli were presented from various directions.
	The monkey could control a motorized, movable device (cab) and its
	route to a target location by pressing the proper one of five available
	bars in an appropriate sequence (spatial moving task). In any of
	several locations in the field, neural responses were evident in
	relation to the presentation of various objects or human movement
	in some relative direction (left, anterior, right) as a directional
	stimulus test. 2. Of 238 hippocampal neurons analyzed, 172 (72.3\%,
	238-66) responded in either the spatial moving task, or to the direction
	from which stimulation was presented, or to the location of the monkey
	in the field, or to some combination of these. 3. The activity of
	79 (33.2\%) neurons was higher when the monkey was in some specific
	location in the field during the spatial moving task, regardless
	of the approach route or other task parameters (place related neurons).
	4. Responses to the task cues in the spatial moving task were evident
	in 110 (46.3\%) neurons (task related neurons). Of these, 77 (32.4\%)
	neurons were not place related. The remaining 33 (13.9\%) neurons
	were both task related and place related. These neurons responded
	to task cues in only that part of the field in which place related
	responses occurred. The neural response to the task cues disappeared
	when the monkey moved out of the place response region. The place
	related and task related neural responses disappeared when the room
	light was switched off. Thus information from the environment outside
	of the cab contributed to the place related and task related responses.
	5. Stimuli presented from certain specific directions induced responses,
	selectively, in 41 (17.2\%) of the neurons (direction related neurons).
	The dependence of the preferred direction was described in one of
	three ways--egocentric, allocentric, or place-direction specific.
	Nineteen egocentric neurons responded to a stimulus only when it
	was presented from a certain direction relative to the orientation
	of the monkey, regardless of the location of the monkey. Eleven allocentric
	neurons responded to a stimulus only when it was presented at a particular
	position in the room, regardless of the location or orientation of
	the monkey.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

@article{ParkYone07,
	Abstract = {The dual-process signal-detection (DPSD) model assumes that recognition
	memory is based on recollection of qualitative information or on
	a signal-detection-based familiarity process. The model has proven
	useful for understanding results from a wide range of memory research,
	including behavioral, neuropsychological, electrophysiological, and
	neuroimaging studies. However, a number of concerns have been raised
	about the model over the years, and it has been suggested that an
	unequal-variance signal-detection (UVSD) model that incorporates
	separate recollection and familiarity processes (J. T. Wixted, 2007)
	may provide an equally good, or even better, account of the data.
	In this article, the authors show that the results of studies that
	differentiate these models support the predictions of the DPSD model
	and indicate that recognition does not reflect the summing of 2 signal-detection
	processes, as the new UVSD model assumes. In addition, the assumptions
	of the DPSD model are clarified in order to address some of the common
	misconceptions about the model. Although important challenges remain,
	hybrid models such as this provide a more useful framework within
	which to understand human memory than do pure signal-detection models.},

	Abstract = {Repetition priming is a core feature of memory processing whose anatomical
	correlates remain poorly understood. In this study, we use advanced
	multimodal imaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
	and magnetoencephalography; MEG) to investigate the spatiotemporal
	profile of repetition priming. We use intracranial electroencephalography
	(iEEG) to validate our fMRI/MEG measurements. Twelve controls completed
	a semantic judgment task with fMRI and MEG that included words presented
	once (new, 'N') and words that repeated (old, 'O'). Six patients
	with epilepsy completed the same task during iEEG recordings. Blood-oxygen
	level dependent (BOLD) responses for N vs. O words were examined
	across the cortical surface and within regions of interest. MEG waveforms
	for N vs. O words were estimated using a noise-normalized minimum
	norm solution, and used to interpret the timecourse of fMRI. Spatial
	concordance was observed between fMRI and MEG repetition effects
	from 350 to 450 ms within bilateral occipitotemporal and medial temporal,
	left prefrontal, and left posterior temporal cortex. Additionally,
	MEG revealed widespread sources within left temporoparietal regions,
	whereas fMRI revealed bilateral reductions in occipitotemporal and
	left superior frontal, and increases in inferior parietal, precuneus,
	and dorsolateral prefrontal activity. BOLD suppression in left posterior
	temporal, left inferior prefrontal, and right occipitotemporal cortex
	correlated with MEG repetition-related reductions. IEEG responses
	from all three regions supported the timecourse of MEG and localization
	of fMRI. Furthermore, iEEG decreases to repeated words were associated
	with decreased gamma power in several regions, providing evidence
	that gamma oscillations are tightly coupled to cognitive phenomena
	and reflect regional activations seen in the BOLD signal.},

	olfactory associative interference during learning (M. E. Hasselmo,
	B. P. Anderson, \& J. M. Bower, 1992; M. E. Hasselmo \& J. M. Bower,
	1993). These results provide behavioral evidence supporting this
	hypothesis. A simultaneous discrimination task required learning
	a baseline odor pair (A+B-) and then, under the influence of scopolamine,
	a novel odor pair (A-C+) with an overlapping component (A) versus
	a novel odor pair (D+E-) with no overlapping component. As predicted
	by the model, rats that received scopolamine (0.50 and 0.25 mg/kg)
	were more impaired at acquiring overlapping than nonoverlapping odor
	pairs relative to their performance under normal saline or methylscopolamine.
	These results support the prediction that the physiological effects
	of acetylcholine can reduce interference between stored odor memories
	during associative learning. },

	Abstract = {Episodic memory retrieval involves multiple component processes, including
	those that occur when information is correctly remembered (retrieval
	success). The present study employed rapid-presentation event-related
	functional MRI that allowed different trial types with short intertrial
	intervals to be sorted such that the hemodynamic response associated
	with retrieval success could be extracted. Specifically, in an old/new
	episodic recognition task, hit trials (correctly recognized old items)
	and correct rejection trials (correctly rejected new items) were
	directly compared. The comparison revealed a mostly left-lateralized
	set of brain regions. Differential activation was most robust in
	left lateral parietal cortex and medial parietal cortex. Additional
	regions of differential activation included left anterior prefrontal
	cortex at or near Brodmann area 10, anterior insula, thalamus, anterior
	cingulate cortex, frontal cortex along inferior frontal gyrus, premotor
	cortex, and presupplementary motor area. These results suggest that
	left frontal and parietal regions modulate activity based on the
	successful retrieval of information from episodic memory. We discuss
	these findings in the context of several recent investigations that
	provide converging results as well as prior studies that have failed
	to detect these changes.},

	semantic and episodic memories, we measured changes in regional cerebral
	blood flow (rCBF) with positron emission tomography (PET) while subjects
	generated single word responses to achromatic line drawings of objects.
	During separate scans, subjects either named each object, retrieved
	a commonly associated color of each object (semantic condition),
	or recalled a previously studied uncommon color of each object (episodic
	condition). Subjects were also scanned while staring at visual noise
	patterns to provide a low level perceptual baseline. Relative to
	the low level baseline, all three conditions revealed bilateral activations
	of posterior regions of the temporal lobes, cerebellum, and left
	lateralized activations in frontal regions. Retrieving semantic information,
	as compared to object naming, activated left inferior temporal, left
	superior parietal, and left frontal cortices. In addition, small
	regions of right frontal cortex were activated. Retrieving episodic
	information, as compared to object naming, activated bilateral medial
	parietal cortex, bilateral retrosplenial cortex, right frontal cortex,
	thalamus, and cerebellum. Direct comparison of the semantic and episodic
	conditions revealed bilateral activation in temporal and frontal
	lobes in the semantic task (left greater than right), and activation
	in medial parietal cortex, retrosplenial cortex, thalamus, and cerebellum
	(but not right frontal regions) in the episodic task. These results
	support the assertion that distinct neural structures mediate semantic
	and episodic memory retrieval. However, they also raise questions
	regarding the specific roles of left temporal and right frontal cortices
	during episodic memory retrieval, in particular.},

	to study neural correlates of such associations. The present PET
	study examined three associative encoding conditions differing in
	the number of words (0, 1, or 2) semantically related to a third
	word representing the name of a semantic category. A recall task
	consisting in the presentation of the category names as cues for
	retrieving the other two members of the triads followed each encoding

	recalled, respectively). A first analysis (partial least squares,
	PLS) of the PET data identified task-related patterns of activity
	for associative encoding and cued-recall tasks. A second analysis
	identified brain regions whose activity was modulated by the number
	of semantic exemplars at encoding. Some of the task-related brain
	regions also showed modulated activity by semantic relatedness and
	consisted in the left inferior prefrontal cortex, right medial temporal
	lobe, fusiform gyrus and inferior temporal gyrus bilaterally. Some
	of these regions showed greater activity when words in a triad were

@article{Desi96,
	Abstract = {Recent studies show that neuronal mechanisms for learning and memory
	both dynamically modulate and permanently alter the representations
	of visual stimuli in the adult monkey cortex. Three commonly observed
	neuronal effects in memory-demanding tasks are repetition suppression,
	enhancement, and delay activity. In repetition suppression, repeated
	experience with the same visual stimulus leads to both short- and
	long-term suppression of neuronal responses in subpopulations of
	visual neurons. Enhancement works in an opposite fashion, in that
	neuronal responses are enhanced for objects with learned behavioral
	relevance. Delay activity is found in tasks in which animals are
	required to actively hold specific information "on-line" for short
	periods. Repetition suppression appears to be an intrinsic property
	of visual cortical areas such as inferior temporal cortex and is
	thought to be important for perceptual learning and priming. By contrast,
	enhancement and delay activity may depend on feedback to temporal
	cortex from prefrontal cortex and are thought to be important for
	working memory. All of these mnemonic effects on neuronal responses
	bias the competitive interactions that take place between stimulus
	representations in the cortex when there is more than one stimulus
	in the visual field. As a result, memory will often determine the
	winner of these competitions and, thus, will determine which stimulus
	is attended.},

	Abstract = {Past experience is hypothesized to reduce computational demands in PFC by providing bottom-up predictive information that informs subsequent stimulus-action mapping. The present fMRI study measured cortical activity reductions ("neural priming"/"repetition suppression") during repeated stimulus classification to investigate the mechanisms through which learning from the past decreases demands on the prefrontal executive system. Manipulation of learning at three levels of representation-stimulus, decision, and response-revealed dissociable neural priming effects in distinct frontotemporal regions, supporting a multiprocess model of neural priming. Critically, three distinct patterns of neural priming were identified in lateral frontal cortex, indicating that frontal computational demands are reduced by three forms of learning: (a) cortical tuning of stimulus-specific representations, (b) retrieval of learned stimulus-decision mappings, and (c) retrieval of learned stimulus-response mappings. The topographic distribution of these neural priming effects suggests a rostrocaudal organization of executive function in lateral frontal cortex.},

	Abstract = {It remains an intriguing question why the medial temporal lobe (MTL) can display either attenuation or enhancement of neural activity following repetition of previously studied items. To isolate the role of encoding experience itself, we assessed neural repetition effects in the absence of any ongoing task demand or intentional orientation to retrieve. Experiment 1 showed that the hippocampus and surrounding MTL regions displayed neural repetition suppression (RS) upon repetition of past items that were merely attended during an earlier study phase but this was not the case following re-occurrence of items that had been encoded into working memory (WM). In this latter case a trend toward neural repetition enhancement (RE) was observed, though this was highly variable across individuals. Interestingly, participants with a higher degree of neural RE in the MTL complex displayed higher memory sensitivity in a later, surprise recognition test. Experiment 2 showed that massive exposure at encoding effected a change in the neural architecture supporting incidental repetition effects, with regions of the posterior parietal and ventral-frontal cortex in addition to the hippocampus displaying neural RE, while no neural RS was observed. The nature of encoding experience therefore modulates the expression of neural repetition effects in the MTL and the neocortex in the absence of memory goals.},

	Abstract = {For nearly two decades, functional neuroimaging studies have attempted
	to shed light on questions about the representation, organization,
	and retrieval of semantic knowledge. This review examines some of
	the major findings in this area. For example, functional neuroimaging
	studies have examined the extent to which there is a unitary semantic
	system or a series of multiple semantic subsystems organized by input
	modality, knowledge attribute, and/or taxonomic category. Additionally,
	functional neuroimaging studies have investigated the contributions
	of frontal cortex to semantic retrieval and selection. Collectively,
	these studies demonstrate that functional neuroimaging can offer
	more than neuroanatomical localization information; in addition,
	these studies offer new insights into longstanding questions about

	Abstract = {The activation of cortical object representations requires the integration of dispersed cortical areas, signified by induced oscillatory bursts of activity > 20 Hz (induced Gamma Band Responses; iGBRs) at approximately 300 ms after stimulus onset. A well established marker of the functional dynamics within such cell assemblies is the suppression of iGBR amplitudes after the repetition of familiar stimuli. This effect is commonly interpreted as a signature of 'sharpening' processes within conceptual networks, which are behaviourally mirrored in repetition priming effects. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the repetition of unfamiliar stimuli leads to iGBR increases indicating the 'formation' of a new cell assembly. A limitation of previous experiments was that only small numbers of repetitions were used. Thus, in the present EEG study we presented familiar and unfamiliar stimuli 10 times. We were able to replicate sharpening effects within conceptual networks representing familiar stimuli. Furthermore, we observed a gradual increase of iGBRs elicited by repeated unfamiliar stimuli. Interestingly, this formation effect did not turn into a sharpening effect after many repetitions (i.e. after an unfamiliar stimulus became familiar). Thus, we conclude that sharpening and formation effects rely on qualitatively different networks representing familiar and unfamiliar material.},

@article{Wang10,
	Abstract = {Synchronous rhythms represent a core mechanism for sculpting
	
	temporal coordination of neural activity in the brain-wide network.
	This review focuses on oscillations in the
	
	cerebral cortex that occur during cognition, in alert behaving conditions.
	Over the last two decades, experimental
	
	and modeling work has made great strides in elucidating the detailed
	cellular and circuit basis of these rhythms,
	
	particularly gamma and theta rhythms. The underlying physiological
	mechanisms are diverse (ranging from resonance
	
	and pacemaker properties of single cells to multiple scenarios for
	population synchronization and wave propagation), but also exhibit
	unifying principles. A major conceptual advance was the realization
	that synaptic
	
	inhibition plays a fundamental role in rhythmogenesis, either in an
	interneuronal network or in a reciprocal
	
	excitatory-inhibitory loop. Computational functions of synchronous
	oscillations in cognition are still a matter of
	
	debate among systems neuroscientists, in part because the notion of
	regular oscillation seems to contradict the
	
	common observation that spiking discharges of individual neurons in
	the cortex are highly stochastic and far from
	
	being clocklike. However, recent findings have led to a framework
	that goes beyond the conventional theory of
	
	coupled oscillators and reconciles the apparent dichotomy between
	irregular single neuron activity and field
	
	potential oscillations. From this perspective, a plethora of studies
	will be reviewed on the involvement of longdistance
	
	neuronal coherence in cognitive functions such as multisensory integration,
	working memory, and selective
	
	attention. Finally, implications of abnormal neural synchronization
	are discussed as they relate to mental disorders
	
	like schizophrenia and autism.},

Results:

A CFA model based on the 3 EF LVs and the 2 intelegence LVs had good fit

Pattern of correlations between EF composits agreed with Miyake et al.'s 2000 study (correlated but separate EFs)


Only updating was sig correlated with Gf (constraining all correlations to be equal worsened fit) (updating = .64, inhibiting = .29, shifting = .13)
 
All EFs were correlated with Gc but updating was higher than inhibiting or shifting (.69 vs .31 {\&}amp; .31) and again constraining them to be equal worsened fit

In an SEM specifying paths between the 3 EFs and both Gf and Gc, only updating had significant paths to either Gf or Gc. Suggests that the relationship between Gc and shifting and inhibiting in the CFA was largely due to their correlation with updating. Also, the correlation between Gf and Gc was reduced (.62 to .17) in the SEM indicating that a large part of the original correlation was due to the influence of updating (and the other EFs) on both.

Discussion

Seem to suggest toward the end the current intelegence tests fail to tap inhibiting and shifting rather than that inhibiting and shifting are not important in intelegence -- but no strong position is taken

ME: Do the intelegence measures they chose preclude correlations with inhibiting and shifting? 

E.g., for Gc they used a vocab test and a general knowledge test -- things known to be robust to deficiencies in inhibition. It is less clear for the Gf measures but both are visual reasoning tasks{\ldots} It is conceivable that they are inherently sensitive to upating (e.g., generating and holding hypotheses) and less sensitive to the other functions (there is not a lot of stimuli involved in a trial and the constant perceptual display of the patterns in ravens could make inhibiting past trials less of an issue). But it could be argued that the same results were found with the global IQ score which should be less selective.

	Abstract = {Object-selective cortical regions exhibit a decreased response when
	an object stimulus is repeated [repetition suppression (RS)]. RS
	is often associated with priming: reduced response times and increased
	accuracy for repeated stimuli. It is unknown whether RS reflects
	stimulus-specific repetition, the associated changes in response
	time, or the combination of the two. To address this question, we
	performed a rapid event-related functional MRI (fMRI) study in which
	we measured BOLD signal in object-selective cortex, as well as object
	recognition performance, while we manipulated stimulus repetition.
	Our design allowed us to examine separately the roles of response
	time and repetition in explaining RS. We found that repetition played
	a robust role in explaining RS: repeated trials produced weaker BOLD
	responses than nonrepeated trials, even when comparing trials with
	matched response times. In contrast, response time played a weak
	role in explaining RS when repetition was controlled for: it explained
	BOLD responses only for one region of interest (ROI) and one experimental
	condition. Thus repetition suppression seems to be mostly driven
	by repetition rather than performance changes. We further examined
	whether RS reflects processes occurring at the same time as recognition
	or after recognition by manipulating stimulus presentation duration.
	In one experiment, durations were longer than required for recognition
	(2 s), whereas in a second experiment, durations were close to the
	minimum time required for recognition (85-101 ms). We found significant
	RS for brief presentations (albeit with a reduced magnitude), which
	again persisted when controlling for performance. This suggests a
	substantial amount of RS occurs during recognition.},

@article{Madd99,
	Abstract = {Averaging across observers is common in psychological research. Often,
	averaging reduces the measurement error and, thus, does not affect
	the inference drawn about the behavior of individuals. However, in
	other situations, averaging alters the structure of the data qualitatively,
	leading to an incorrect inference about the behavior of individuals.
	In this research, the influence of averaging across observers on
	the fits of decision bound models (Ashby, 1992a) and generalized
	context models (GCM; Nosofsky, 1986) was investigated through Monte
	Carlo simulation of a variety of categorization conditions, perceptual
	representations, and individual difference assumptions and in an
	experiment. The results suggest that (1) averaging has little effect
	when the GCM is the correct model, (2) averaging often improves the
	fit of the GCM and worsens the fit of the decision bound model when
	the decision bound model is the correct model, (3) the GCM is quite
	flexible and, under many conditions, can mimic the predictions of
	the decision bound model, whereas the decision bound model is generally
	unable to mimic the predictions of the GCM, (4) the validity of the
	decision bound model's perceptual representation assumption can have
	a large effect on the inference drawn about the form of the decision
	bound, and (5) the experiment supported the claim that averaging
	improves the fit of the GCM. These results underscore the importance
	of performing single-observer analysis if one is interested in understanding
	the categorization performance of individuals.},

	Annote = {***(REDO THIS)*** Previously a physiological network model for short-term
	memory (STM) has been suggested in which brain oscillations in the
	5-11 Hz band (theta/alpha band) are involved in active maintenance
	and recall of STM representations (Lisman and Idiart, Science 267:1512;
	Jensen and Lisman, JNS 18:10668). This model can account for the
	reaction time distributions of the classical STM paradigm: the Sternberg
	task. In this task subjects are required to retain a list of 1,3,
	5 or 7 digits during a 3 second retention period. We investigated
	the role of theta activity in a visual Sternberg task using a whole-scalp
	magnetoencephalographic (MEG) array. Responses from 10 normal subjects
	revealed ongoing theta activity as a peak in the power spectrum recorded
	by frontal midline sensors. During the retention period, the power
	of the theta activity increased parametrically with the number of
	items retained in STM. A time-frequency analysis revealed that the
	theta activity remained strong during the full retention period.
	These observations are in accord with the predictions of the oscillatory
	model of short-term memory.},

	maximize the rate of receiving rewards for correct choices. This
	article suggests that the models of decision making that are proposed
	on different levels of abstraction can be linked by virtue of the

	that many aspects of the circuit that involves the cortex and basal
	ganglia are the same as those that are required to perform statistically

	Abstract = {Neurons can produce action potentials with high temporal precision.
	A fundamental issue is whether, and how, this capability is used
	in information processing. According to the 'cell assembly' hypothesis,
	transient synchrony of anatomically distributed groups of neurons
	underlies processing of both external sensory input and internal
	cognitive mechanisms. Accordingly, neuron populations should be arranged
	into groups whose synchrony exceeds that predicted by common modulation
	by sensory input. Here we find that the spike times of hippocampal
	pyramidal cells can be predicted more accurately by using the spike
	times of simultaneously recorded neurons in addition to the animals
	location in space. This improvement remained when the spatial prediction
	was refined with a spatially dependent theta phase modulation. The
	time window in which spike times are best predicted from simultaneous
	peer activity is 10-30 ms, suggesting that cell assemblies are synchronized
	at this timescale. Because this temporal window matches the membrane
	time constant of pyramidal neurons, the period of the hippocampal
	gamma oscillation and the time window for synaptic plasticity, we
	propose that cooperative activity at this timescale is optimal for
	information transmission and storage in cortical circuits.},

	Abstract = {As a structure involved in learning and memory, the hippocampus functions
	as a network. The functional differentiation along the longitudinal
	axis of the hippocampus is poorly demarcated in comparison with the
	transverse axis. Using patch clamp recordings in conjunction with
	post hoc anatomy, we have examined the pattern of connectivity and
	the functional differentiation along the long axis of the hippocampus.
	Here, we provide anatomical and physiological evidence that the prominent
	rhythmic network activities of the hippocampus, the behavior-specific
	gamma and theta oscillations, are seen predominantly along the transverse
	and longitudinal axes respectively. This orthogonal relationship
	is the result of the axonal field trajectories and the consequential
	interaction of the principal cells and major interneuron subtypes
	involved in generating each rhythm. Thus, the axonal arborization
	patterns of hippocampal inhibitory cells may represent a structural
	framework for the spatiotemporal distribution of activity observed
	within the hippocampus.},

	Annote = {The coherent representation of an object in the visual system has
	been suggested to be achieved by the synchronization in the gamma-band
	(30-70 Hz) of a distributed neuronal assembly. Here we measure variations
	of high-frequency activity on the human scalp. The experiment is
	designed to allow the comparison of two different perceptions of
	the same picture. In the first condition, an apparently meaningless
	picture that contained a hidden Dalmatian, a neutral stimulus, and
	a target stimulus (twirled blobs) are presented. After the subject
	has been trained to perceive the hidden dog and its mirror image,
	the second part of the recordings is performed (condition 2). The
	same neutral stimulus is presented, intermixed with the picture of
	the dog and its mirror image (target stimulus). Early (95 msec) phase-locked
	(or stimulus-locked) gamma-band oscillations do not vary with stimulus
	type but can be subdivided into an anterior component (38 Hz) and
	a posterior component (35 Hz). Nonphase-locked gamma-band oscillations
	appear with a latency jitter around 280 msec after stimulus onset
	and disappear in averaged data. They increase in amplitude in response
	to both target stimuli. They also globally increase in the second
	condition compared with the first one. It is suggested that this
	gamma-band energy increase reflects both bottom-up (binding of elementary
	features) and top-down (search for the hidden dog) activation of
	the same neural assembly coding for the Dalmatian. The relationships
	between high- and low-frequency components of the response are discussed,
	and a possible functional role of each component is suggested.},

	for a time and interact passively with incoming stimulation, some
	tasks require that the memory be actively maintained and used. To
	test for the existence of separate automatic and volitional mechanisms
	of short-term memory, recordings were made from neurons in the inferior
	temporal cortex of monkeys while the monkeys held a sample picture
	"in mind" and signaled when it was repeated in a sequence of pictures,
	ignoring other stimulus repetitions. Some neurons were suppressed
	by any picture repetition, regardless of relevance, whereas others
	were enhanced, but only when a picture matched the sample. Short-term
	memory appears to reflect the parallel operation of these two mechanisms--one
	being automatic and the other active.},

	Abstract = {Many mental tasks that involve operations on a number of items take
	place within a few hundred milliseconds. In such tasks, whether the
	items are processed simultaneously (in parallel) or sequentially
	(serially) has long been of interest to psychologists. Although certain
	types of parallel and serial models have been ruled out, it has proven
	extremely difficult to entirely separate reasonable serial and limited-capacity
	parallel models on the basis of typical data. Recent advances in
	theory-driven methodology now permit strong tests of serial versus
	parallel processing in such tasks, in ways that bypass the capacity
	issue and that are distribution and parameter free. We employ new
	methodologies to assess serial versus parallel processing and find
	strong evidence for pure serial or pure parallel processing, with
	some striking apparent differences across individuals and interstimulus
	conditions.},

	Abstract = {The hippocampal formation can encode relative spatial location, without
	reference to external cues, by the integration of linear and angular
	self-motion (path integration). Theoretical studies, in conjunction
	with recent empirical discoveries, suggest that the medial entorhinal
	cortex (MEC) might perform some of the essential underlying computations
	by means of a unique, periodic synaptic matrix that could be self-organized
	in early development through a simple, symmetry-breaking operation.
	The scale at which space is represented increases systematically
	along the dorsoventral axis in both the hippocampus and the MEC,
	apparently because of systematic variation in the gain of a movement-speed
	signal. Convergence of spatially periodic input at multiple scales,
	from so-called grid cells in the entorhinal cortex, might result
	in non-periodic spatial firing patterns (place fields) in the hippocampus.},

	Abstract = {Presenting a word enhances its later perceptual identification. This article focuses on the relation between this effect on perception and recognition memory. Prior experiments have revealed that perceptual enhancement is independent of recognition memory and have led to the two types of task being identified with separate memory systems. In contrast, the present experiments reveal parallel effects on the two types of task. Perceptual enhancement persists over days but, like recognition memory, is influenced by manipulations of retrieval conditions. I conclude that both perceptual and memory tasks rely on the retrieval of memory for whole prior processing episodes but can differ in terms of the number and nature of retrieval cues that they provide. I describe perception and memory within a common framework.},

	Abstract = {The temporal context model (TCM) [. A distributed representation of
	temporal context. Journal of Mathematical Psychology, 46(3), 269-299]
	was proposed to describe recency and associative effects observed
	in episodic recall. Episodic recall depends on an intact medial temporal
	lobe, a region of the brain that also supports a place code. Howard,
	Fotedar, Datey, and Hasselmo [. The temporal context model in spatial
	navigation and relational learning: Toward a common explanation of
	medial temporal lobe function across domains. Psychological Review,
	112(1), 75-116] demonstrated that the leaky integrator that supports
	a gradually changing representation of temporal context in TCM is
	sufficient to describe properties of cells observed in ventromedial
	entorhinal cortex during spatial navigation if it is provided with
	input about the animal's current velocity. This representation of
	temporal context generates noisy place cells in the open field, unlike
	the clearly defined place cells observed in the hippocampus. Here
	we demonstrate that a reasonably accurate spatial representation
	can be extracted from temporal context with as few as eight cells,
	suggesting that the spatial precision observed in the place code
	in the hippocampus is not inconsistent with the input from a representation
	of temporal-spatial context in entorhinal cortex.},

	Abstract = {There is currently a debate as to whether event-related potentials
	and fields measured by using electroencephalography or magnetoencephalography
	are generated by ongoing oscillatory activity becoming phase-reset
	in response to a given stimulus. We performed a magnetoencephalography
	study measuring brain activity in response to visual stimuli. Using
	a measure termed the phase-preservation index we investigated the
	phase of oscillatory alpha activity (8-13 Hz) before and after the
	stimulus. We found that in single trials the alpha oscillations after
	visual stimuli preserve their phase relationship with respect to
	the phase before the stimuli. This finding argues against phase-resetting
	of ongoing oscillations as being responsible for visually evoked
	responses. The event-related field can be explained primarily by
	stimulus-locked activity in the theta band that is absent before
	the stimulus. These findings suggest that different neuronal events
	are responsible for generating the ongoing oscillations and the visually
	evoked responses.},

Want to determine if healthy olders who will eventually develop MCI show any EEG markers that distinguish them from those who will remain healthy.

Record eyes closed EEG at T1. Followup 7 years later. 

Find that those who declined (by the Global Deterioration Scale) showed greater theta power, slower mean frequencies within bands, and changes in the covariances between electrode sites. A logistic regression using EEG features to predict decline/stability over the 7 years was 90% accurate.},

	Abstract = {A multistudy analysis of positron emission tomography data identified
	three right prefrontal and two left prefrontal cortical sites, as
	well as a region in the anterior cingulate gyrus, where neuronal
	activity is correlated with the maintenance of episodic memory retrieval
	mode (REMO), a basic and necessary condition of remembering past
	experiences. The right prefrontal sites were near the frontal pole
	[Brodmann's area (BA) 10], frontal operculum (BA 47/45), and lateral
	dorsal area (BA 8/9). The two left prefrontal sites were homotopical
	with the right frontal pole and opercular sites. The same kinds of
	REMO sites were not observed in any other cerebral region. Many previous
	functional neuroimaging studies of episodic memory retrieval have
	reported activations near the frontal REMO sites identified here,
	although their function has not been clear. Many of these, too, probably
	have signaled their involvement in REMO. We propose that REMO activations
	largely if not entirely account for the frontal hemispheric asymmetry
	of retrieval as described by the original hemispheric encoding retrieval
	asymmetry model.},

	22.5 years) and older (mean age 74.1 years) adults. To isolate purely
	visual memory, recognition was tested with sets of briefly-presented
	compound sinusoidal gratings, which minimized age-related differences
	in visual processing, and resisted verbal encoding. Recognition was
	measured after delays of 1, 2 or 4 seconds. Overall, neither accuracy
	of recognition nor speed of response differed significantly between
	groups, or with probe delay, which strengthens recent claims that
	visual memory tends to be spared during the course of normal aging.},

	Abstract = {{We examined a visual search task, in which observers responded to
	the high-acuity aspect of a pop-out target (shape of an odd-colored
	diamond or vernier offset of an odd spatial-frequency patch). Repetition
	of the attention-driving feature (color or spatial frequency) in
	this task primes the pop-out; repetition of the high-acuity aspect
	(shape, vernier offset) does not. Priming of pop-out is due to a
	decaying memory trace of the attention-focusing feature laid down
	with each trial. The trace exerts a diminishing effect over the following
	five to eight trials (approximately 30 sec), and its influence over
	this time is cumulative. Observers cannot wilfully overcome the priming,
	which suggests that it is passive and autonomous. Both target facilitation
	and distractor inhibition are evident; the former has a greater effect.
	The phenomenon shows complete binocular transfer.}},

	Abstract = {Studied the procedure by which high dimensional semantic (SM) spaces
	may be constructed in an automated fashion from text bodies, and
	how these spaces can model human concept similarity underlying the
	development of hyperspace analog to language. A `window,' representing
	a span of words, was passed over the text body being analyzed. In
	Exp 1, the distances between word vectors (VCs) were studied to see
	if similarity in word meaning corresponded to that in VC element
	patterns. Exp 2 tested if the relationship found in Exp 1 could be
	used in categorization and classification tasks. In Exp 3, the effects
	of window size and distance metric and their performance as related
	to human performance was studied. The SM field surrounding the concept
	included aspects of a word's relationship to other words. The VCs
	could be used to classify instances of superordinate categories.
	SM distances correlated with human reaction times. (PsycINFO Database

	Abstract = {Patterns of neural firing linked to eye movement decisions show that
	behavioral decisions are predicted by the differential firing rates
	of cells coding selected and nonselected stimulus alternatives. These
	results can be interpreted using models developed in mathematical
	psychology to model behavioral decisions. Current models assume that
	decisions are made by accumulating noisy stimulus information until
	sufficient information for a response is obtained. Here, the models,
	and the techniques used to test them against response-time distribution
	and accuracy data, are described. Such models provide a quantitative
	link between the time-course of behavioral decisions and the growth
	of stimulus information in neural firing data.},

	to examine the memory processes underlying recognition memory. The
	authors discuss the methodological issues involved in conducting
	and analyzing ROC results, describe the various models that have
	been developed to account for these results, review the behavioral
	empirical literature, and assess the models in light of those results.
	The empirical literature includes studies of item recognition, relational
	recognition (e.g., source and associative tests), as well as exclusion
	and remember-know tasks. Nine empirical regularities are described,
	and a number of unresolved empirical issues are identified. The results
	indicate that several common classes of recognition models, such
	as pure threshold and pure signal detection models, are inadequate
	to account for recognition memory, whereas several hybrid models
	that incorporate a signal detection-based process and a threshold
	recollection or attention process are in better agreement with the
	results. The results indicate that there are at least 2 functionally
	distinct component/processes underlying recognition memory. In addition,
	the ROC results have various implications for how recognition memory
	performance should be measured.},

	Abstract = {Evidence is presented that recognition judgments are based on an assessment
	of familiarity, as is described by signal detection theory, but that
	a separate recollection process also contributes to performance.
	In 3 receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) experiments, the process
	dissociation procedure was used to examine the contribution of these
	processes to recognition memory. In Experiments 1 and 2, reducing
	the length of the study list increased the intercept (d') but decreased
	the slope of the ROC and increased the probability of recollection
	but left familiarity relatively unaffected. In Experiment 3, increasing
	study time increased the intercept but left the slope of the ROC
	unaffected and increased both recollection and familiarity. In all
	3 experiments, judgments based on familiarity produced a symmetrical
	ROC (slope = 1), but recollection introduced a skew such that the
	slope of the ROC decreased.},
	Annote = {Recollection and familiarity differ in terms of the type of information
	that they provide and the extent to which each process influences
	recognition confidence. Familiarity is assumed to reflect assessment
	of quantitative memory strength is a manner similar to that described
	by signal detection theory. In contrast recollection reflects a threshold
	retrieval process whereby qualitative information about a previous
	event. Subjects may retrieve different aspects of the study event
	(spatial and temporal context, associations) but for some items subjects
	are unable to retrieve qualitative information and must therefore
	rely on assessments of familiarity. Recollection is expected to support
	high confidence decisions while familiarity supports a range of confidence
	responses. Both are independant and act in parallel. Familiarity
	is faster than recollection and recollection should be affected with
	hippocampal damage and familiarity would be affected if additional
	MTL regions are damaged. While all models do not make explicit claims
	regarding response speed models assume familiarity is subserved by
	brain regions earlier in the processing stream than regions supporting
	recollection and thus this is consistent with the expectation that
	familiarity would be a faster process.},

	Annote = {Describes a model of free recall which identifies 2 processes: (a)
	retrieval, by which S accesses the words; and (b) recognition, by
	which S decides whether an implicitly retrieved word is a to-be-recalled
	word. Submodels for the recognition and retrieval processes are described.
	The recognition model assumes that during the study phase, S associates
	`list markers' to the to-be-recalled words. The establishment of
	such associates is postulated to be an all-or-none stochastic process.
	In the test phase, S recognizes to-be-recalled words by deciding
	which words have relevant list markers as associates. A signal detectability
	model is developed for this decision process. The retrieval model
	is introduced as a computer program that tags associative paths between
	list words. In 4 experiments, 41 male and 52 female 16-32 yr. old
	Ss studied and were tested on a sequence of overlapping sublists
	sampled from a master set of common nouns. Results confirm the prediction
	that S's ability to retrieve the words would increase as more overlapping
	sublists were studied, but his ability to differentiate the words
	on the most recent list should deteriorate. Further predictions derived
	from the free recall model were also supported. (56 ref.) ((c) 1999

	Abstract = {Recognition memory, source memory, and exclusion performance are three
	important domains of study in memory, each with its own findings,
	it specific theoretical developments, and its separate research literature.
	It is proposed here that results from all three domains can be treated
	with a single analytic model. This article shows how to generate
	a comprehensive memory representation based on multidimensional signal
	detection theory and how to make predictions for each of these paradigms
	using decision axes drawn through the space. The detection model
	is simpler than the comparable multinomial model, it is more easily
	generalizable, and it does not make threshold assumptions. An experiment
	using the same memory set for all three tasks demonstrates the analysis
	and tests the model. The results show that some seemingly complex
	relations between the paradigms derive from an underlying simplicity
	of structure.},

@article{DonaRugg98,
	Annote = { The electrophysiological correlates of recognition memory for new
	associations were investigated in two experiments. In both experiments
	subjects first studied unrelated word pairs. At test, they were presented
	with old words in the same pairing as at study (same pairs), old
	words in a different pairing from study (rearranged pairs), and pairs
	of new words. In Experiment 1 the test requirement was to discriminate
	between old and new pairs and, for any pair judged old, to then judge
	whether the pair was the same or rearranged. In Experiment 2 the
	requirement was merely to discriminate between old and new pairs.
	Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded for correctly classified
	same, rearranged and new pairs. The ERPs elicited by same pairs exhibited
	a similar pattern of effects in both experiments. Relative to the
	ERPs to new pairs, these effects took the form of sustained positive
	shifts with two distinct scalp maxima, over the left temporo-parietal
	and right frontal scalp respectively. ERPs to rearranged pairs showed
	effects which were similar in scalp topography, but markedly smaller
	in magnitude. This pattern of ERP effects closely resembles that
	found previously for test items defined as recollected on the basis
	of their attracting a successful source judgement. The findings therefore
	suggest that associative recognition memory shares some of the recollective
	processes that are engaged by the requirement to retrieve contextual
	information about a study episode. The findings from Experiment 2
	indicate that the processes associated with the recollection of associated
	pairs are engaged regardless of whether the retrieval of associative
	information is an explicit task requirement.},

	Abstract = {The question of whether recognition memory judgments with and without
	recollection reflect dissociable patterns of brain activity is unresolved.
	We used event-related, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
	of 12 healthy volunteers to measure hemodynamic responses associated
	with both studying and recognizing words. Volunteers made one of
	three judgments to each word during recognition: whether they recollected
	seeing it during study (R judgments), whether they experienced a
	feeling of familiarity in the absence of recollection (K judgments),
	or whether they did not remember seeing it during study (N judgments).
	Both R and K judgments for studied words were associated with enhanced
	responses in left prefrontal and left parietal cortices relative
	to N judgments for unstudied words. The opposite pattern was observed
	in bilateral temporoccipital regions and amygdalae. R judgments for
	studied words were associated with enhanced responses in anterior
	left prefrontal, left parietal, and posterior cingulate regions relative
	to K judgments. At study, a posterior left prefrontal region exhibited
	an enhanced response to words subsequently given R versus K judgments,
	but the response of this region during recognition did not differentiate
	R and K judgments. K judgments for studied words were associated
	with enhanced responses in right lateral and medial prefrontal cortex
	relative to both R judgments for studied words and N judgments for
	unstudied words, a difference we attribute to greater monitoring
	demands when memory judgments are less certain. These results suggest
	that the responses of different brain regions do dissociate according
	to the phenomenology associated with memory retrieval.},

	Abstract = {Prefrontal cortex plays a central role in mnemonic control, with left
	inferior prefrontal cortex (LIPC) mediating control of semantic knowledge.
	One prominent theory posits that LIPC does not mediate semantic retrieval
	per se, but rather subserves the selection of task-relevant knowledge
	from amidst competing knowledge. The present event-related fMRI study
	provides evidence for an alternative hypothesis: LIPC guides controlled
	semantic retrieval irrespective of whether retrieval requires selection
	against competing representations. With selection demands held constant,
	LIPC activation increased with semantic retrieval demands and with
	the level of control required during retrieval. LIPC mediates a top-down
	bias signal that is recruited to the extent that the recovery of
	meaning demands controlled retrieval. Selection may reflect a specific
	instantiation of this mechanism.},

@article{SloaEtal10,
	Abstract = {Increases in neuronal activity induce local increases in cerebral
	perfusion. However, our understanding of the processes underlying
	this neurovascular coupling remains incomplete and, particularly,
	how these vary across the brain. Recent work supports an important
	role for astrocytes in neurovascular coupling, in large part via
	activation of their metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR). Here,
	using a combination of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
	and electrophysiology we demonstrate regional heterogeneity in the
	mechanisms underlying neurovascular coupling. Direct electrical stimulation
	of the rat hindpaw sensorimotor cortex induces blood oxygenation
	level dependent (BOLD) and cerebral blood volume (CBV) fMRI responses
	in several anatomically distinct cortical and subcortical structures.
	Following intraperitoneal administration of the type 5 mGluR antagonist,
	MPEP, both BOLD and CBV responses to cortical stimulation were significantly
	reduced, whilst the local field potential (LFP) responses remained
	largely constant. Spatially, the degree of reduction in fMRI responses
	varied between cortical and subcortical regions (primary cortex approximately
	18% vs. striatum approximately 66%), and also between primary and
	secondary cortical areas ( approximately 18% vs. approximately 55%).
	Similarly, greater decreases in response amplitude were seen in the
	contralateral secondary cortex ( approximately 91%) and ipsilateral
	striatum (approximately 70%), compared to the primary cortex (approximately
	44%). Following MPEP, a negative component of the BOLD and CBV responses
	became more apparent, suggesting that different mechanisms mediate
	vasodilatory and vasoconstrictory responses. Interestingly, under
	baseline conditions the quantitative relationship between fMRI and
	LFP responses in cortical and subcortical regions was markedly different.
	Our data indicate that coupling between neuronal and fMRI responses
	is neither empirically nor mechanistically consistent across the
	brain.},

	Abstract = {Cognitive neuroscience relies on two sets of techniques to map the
	neural networks underlying cognition in humans: recordings of either
	regional metabolic changes (fMRI or PET) or fluctuations in the neural
	electromagnetic fields (EEG and MEG). Despite major advances in the
	last few years, an explicit linkage between the two is still missing
	and the neuroimaging community faces two complementary but unrelated
	sets of functional descriptions of the human brain. Such an explicit
	framework, linking the two approaches in potentially complex cognitive
	tasks and in a variety of brain regions would permit to combine them
	into fine spatio-temporally-grained human brain mapping procedures.
	We combined fMRI and intra-cranial EEG recordings of the same epileptic
	patients during a semantic decision task and found a close spatial
	correspondence between regions of fMRI activations and recording
	sites showing EEG energy modulations in the gamma range (>40 Hz).
	Our findings further support previous findings that gamma band modulations
	co-localize with BOLD variations and also indicate that fMRI may
	be used as a constraint to improve source reconstruction of gamma
	band EEG responses. Hum Brain Mapp, 2007. (c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

@article{MaddEtal01,
	Abstract = {Most functional imaging studies of memory retrieval investigate memory
	for standardized laboratory stimuli. However, naturally acquired
	autobiographical memories differ from memories of standardized stimuli
	in important ways. Neuroimaging studies of natural memories may reveal
	distinctive patterns of brain activation and may have particular
	value in assessing clinical disorders of memory. This study used
	functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate brain activation
	during successful retrieval of autobiographical memories elicited
	by name-cued recall of family members and friends. The caudal part
	of the left posterior cingulate cortex was the most strongly activated
	region and was significantly activated in all eight subjects studied.
	Most subjects also showed significant activation of the left anterior
	orbitomedial, anterior middle frontal, precuneus, cuneus, and posterior
	inferior parietal cortices, and the right posterior cingulate and
	motor cortices.Our findings are consistent with prior studies showing
	posterior cingulate cortex activation during autobiographical memory
	retrieval. This region is also consistently activated during retrieval
	of standardized memory stimuli when experimental designs emphasizing
	successful retrieval are employed. Our results support the hypothesis
	that the posterior cingulate cortex plays an important role in successful
	memory retrieval. The posterior cingulate cortex has strong reciprocal
	connections with entorhinal and parahippocampal cortices. Studies
	of early Alzheimer's disease, temporal lobectomy, and hypoxic amnesia
	show that hypometabolism of the posterior cingulate cortex is an
	early and prominent indicator of pathology in these patients. Our
	findings suggest that autobiographical memory retrieval tasks could
	be used to probe the functional status of the posterior cingulate
	cortex in patients with early Alzheimer's disease or at risk for
	that condition.},

	Abstract = {Previous research has shown that when the targets of successive visual
	searches have features in common, response times are shorter. However,
	the nature of the representation underlying this priming and how
	priming is affected by the task remain uncertain. In four experiments,
	subjects searched for an odd-sized target and reported its orientation.
	The color of the items was irrelevant to the task. When target size
	was repeated from the previous trial, repetition of target color
	speeded the response. However, when target size was different from
	that in the previous trial, repetition of target color slowed responses,
	rather than speeding them. Our results suggest that these priming
	phenomena reflect the same automatic mechanism as the priming of
	pop-out reported by Maljkovic and Nakayama (1994). However, the crossover
	interaction between repetition of one feature and another rules out
	Maljkovic and Nakayama's (1994) theory of independent potentiation
	of distinct feature representations. Instead, we suggest that the
	priming pattern results from contact with an episodic memory representation
	of the previous trial.},

	Abstract = {Behavioral dissociations suggest that a single experience can separately influence multiple processing components. Here we used a repetition priming functional magnetic resonance imaging paradigm that directly contrasted the effects of stimulus and decision changes to identify the underlying brain systems. Direct repetition of stimulus features caused marked reductions in posterior regions of the inferior temporal lobe that were insensitive to whether the decision was held constant or changed between study and test. By contrast, prefrontal cortex showed repetition effects that were sensitive to the exact stimulus-to-decision mapping. Analysis of resting-state functional connectivity revealed that the dissociated repetition effects are embedded within distinct brain systems. Regions that were sensitive to changes in the stimulus correlated with perceptual cortices, whereas the decision changes attenuated activity in regions correlated with middle-temporal regions and a frontoparietal control system. These results thus explain the long-known dissociation between perceptual and conceptual components of priming by revealing how a single experience can separately influence distinct, concurrently active brain systems.},

	the targets were line drawings of familiar everyday objects or combinations
	of parts of everyday objects. In Experiment 2, the non-target objects
	were everyday objects and the targets were possible and impossible

	waveforms than did first presentations beginning at about 300 ms.
	The briefly reduced frontal negativity to repeated items is consistent

	The polarity of the parieto-occipital effect was the reverse of what

	Abstract = {The neural response to stimulus repetition is not uniform across brain regions, stimulus modalities, or task contexts. For instance, it has been observed in many functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies that sometimes stimulus repetition leads to a relative reduction in neural activity (repetition suppression), whereas in other cases repetition results in a relative increase in activity (repetition enhancement). In the present study, we hypothesized that in the context of a verbal short-term recognition memory task, repetition-related "increases" should be observed in the same posterior temporal regions that have been previously associated with "persistent activity" in working memory rehearsal paradigms. We used fMRI and a continuous recognition memory paradigm with short lags to examine repetition effects in the posterior and anterior regions of the superior temporal cortex. Results showed that, consistent with our hypothesis, the 2 posterior temporal regions consistently associated with working memory maintenance, also show repetition increases during short-term recognition memory. In contrast, a region in the anterior superior temporal lobe showed repetition suppression effects, consistent with previous research work on perceptual adaptation in the auditory-verbal domain. We interpret these results in light of recent theories of the functional specialization along the anterior and posterior axes of the superior temporal lobe.},

	Abstract = {Repetition suppression (RS) in cortical sensory systems optimizes the size of neuronal ensemble reacting to repetitive stimuli such as sounds. Recently RS has also been demonstrated to occur with mental imaging of movement. We studied the existence of RS in the motor system using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Six healthy subjects participated in this study. TMS was focused on the primary motor cortex with neuronavigation and RS was studied by measuring the motor-evoked potentials from the contralateral first dorsal interosseous muscle. At the same time, we measured TMS-induced cortical responses using electroencephalography (EEG). For a comparison baseline, we evaluated RS by recording EEG responses to sounds with the same stimulation protocol as with TMS. Each stimulus train included four identical stimuli repeated at 1-s intervals, and the stimulation trains were repeated at 20-s intervals. The response amplitude was reduced significantly (p<.01) after the first stimulus in all stimulus trains. This suggests that RS may be a general mechanism for adaptation of neuronal population responses in the human cortex.},

@article{GrubEtal06,
	Abstract = {The formation of cortical object representations requires the activation
	of cell assemblies, correlated by induced oscillatory bursts of activity
	> 20 Hz (induced gamma band responses; iGBRs). One marker of the
	functional dynamics within such cell assemblies is the suppression
	of iGBRs elicited by repeated stimuli. This effect is commonly interpreted
	as a signature of 'sharpening' processes within cell-assemblies,
	which are behaviourally mirrored in repetition priming effects. The
	present study investigates whether the sharpening of primed objects
	is an automatic consequence of repeated stimulus processing, or whether
	it depends on task demands. Participants performed either a 'living/non-living'
	or a 'bigger/smaller than a shoebox' classification on repeated pictures
	of everyday objects. We contrasted repetition-related iGBR effects
	after the same task was used for initial and repeated presentations
	(no-switch condition) with repetitions after a task-switch occurred
	(switch condition). Furthermore, we complemented iGBR analysis by
	examining other brain responses known to be modulated by repetition-related
	memory processes (evoked gamma oscillations and event-related potentials;
	ERPs). The results obtained for the 'no-switch' condition replicated
	previous findings of repetition suppression of iGBRs at 200-300 ms
	after stimulus onset. Source modelling showed that this effect was
	distributed over widespread cortical areas. By contrast, after a
	task-switch no iGBR suppression was found. We concluded that iGBRs
	reflect the sharpening of a cell assembly only within the same task.
	After a task switch the complete object representation is reactivated.
	The ERP (220-380 ms) revealed suppression effects independent of
	task demands in bilateral posterior areas and might indicate correlates
	of repetition priming in perceptual structures.},

	Abstract = {Recent exposure to a stimulus improves performance with subsequent
	identification of that same stimulus. This ubiquitous, yet simple,

	widespread phenomenon called repetition suppression, which is a repetition-induced

	competing models of the neural basis of repetition suppression were

	effectively masked object stimuli showed repetition enhancement of
	brain activation instead of suppression. This finding is consistent
	with an Accumulation model, but is inconsistent with a Suppression
	model of neural activity. Enhanced activation and the improved behavioral
	performance usually associated with priming are both explained by
	a shift in peak latency of the population neural activity elicited

	behavior. While the nature of these representations remains poorly
	understood, existing theories share a number of basic assumptions.
	One of these is that task representations are discrete, independent,

	to which task representations are instead viewed as graded, distributed
	patterns occupying a shared, continuous representational space. In
	recent work, we have implemented this view in a computational model
	of routine sequential action. In the present article, we focus specifically
	on this model's implications for understanding task representation,
	considering the implications of the account for two influential concepts:
	(1) cognitive underspecification, the idea that task representations
	may be imprecise or vague, especially in contexts where errors occur,
	and (2) information-sharing, the idea that closely related operations
	rely on common sets of internal representations.},

	Abstract = {The authors present a computational model that builds a holographic
	lexicon representing both word meaning and word order from unsupervised
	experience with natural language. The model uses simple convolution
	and superposition mechanisms (cf. B. B. Murdock, 1982) to learn distributed
	holographic representations for words. The structure of the resulting
	lexicon can account for empirical data from classic experiments studying
	semantic typicality, categorization, priming, and semantic constraint
	in sentence completions. Furthermore, order information can be retrieved
	from the holographic representations, allowing the model to account
	for limited word transitions without the need for built-in transition
	rules. The model demonstrates that a broad range of psychological
	data can be accounted for directly from the structure of lexical
	representations learned in this way, without the need for complexity
	to be built into either the processing mechanisms or the representations.
	The holographic representations are an appropriate knowledge representation
	to be used by higher order models of language comprehension, relieving
	the complexity required at the higher level.},

	Annote = {Review evidence that high theta power in older adults is associated with MCI and transition to AD.

Review evidence that in young adults high theta power is actually associated with better performance on memory and attention tasks.

Some of their past work has shown that among healthy older adults decreasing theta power predicted decreasing cognitive performance 

Want to investigate this apparent ambiguity in a large sample of healthy olders 

EEG was recorded for 4min of eyes-closed rest. The resulting EEG was correlated with a variety of behavioral measures that were administered prior to the EEG recording (i.e., no EEG was collected during task performance).

Fz theta power was positivity correlated with several memory tests, ravens, and category fluency. It was negativity correlated with RT variability on the Sustained Attention to Response test. IT was uncorrelated with age, NART, MMSE, digit span forward and backward, other SART measures, anxiety scores, depression scores, and peak alpha frequency. Pz theta showed positive correlations only with a prose recall memory test (all other correlations with Pz theta were NS).

Suggest that the findings of increased theta power being associated with INCREASED risk of AD/MCI are due to general slowing of EEG rythms such that increased theta power comes from a shift down in the peak alpha frequency. By contrast, the current study did not find any effect of peak alpha frequency suggesting that the positive correlations between theta power and cognition are not due to such slowing.},

	Abstract = {The emergence of brain imaging has had a major impact on research
	into the cognitive and neural bases of human memory. An area in which
	this impact has been particularly strong is retrieval processing
	- the processes engaged when attempting to retrieve information during
	a memory test. Several different classes of retrieval process - such
	as 'mode', 'effort' and 'success' - have been invoked to account
	for findings from neuroimaging studies of episodic retrieval. In
	this article we discuss how these different kinds of process, along
	with a fourth kind associated with 'retrieval orientation', can be
	investigated in brain imaging experiments. We then review studies
	of retrieval processing, and assess how well their designs match
	up to our proposed criteria for dissociating the neural correlates
	of different classes of retrieval process. We conclude that few studies
	have used designs that permit these different kinds of process to
	be independently identified, and that presently there is little evidence
	to indicate which kinds of processing can be fractionated in terms
	of their neural correlates.},

@article{McDeEtal00,
	Abstract = {Neural regions associated with retrieval success were identified using
	event-related fMRI procedures and randomly ordered trials on a recognition
	memory test. Differences between hits and correct rejections (CRs)
	occurred multiple regions, including bilateral anterior and right
	dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, bilateral inferior parietal cortex,
	and right superior parietal cortex (all hits > CRs), and right occipital
	cortex (CRs > hits). The hit > CR pattern is not compromised by time-on-task
	explanations because response latencies for correctly rejected words
	exceeded those for hits. Converging evidence for the claim that the
	hit > CR pattern identified neural correlates of retrieval success
	was obtained by unconfounding item history and retrieval success.
	That is, we implemented a third condition in which nonstudied words
	were presented, yet retrieval success was hypothesized to facilitate
	CRs of these lures. Specifically, in when confronted with a familiar,
	yet nonstudied word, (e.g., nosedive after studying nosebleed and
	skydive), subjects might adopt a strategy whereby they recall the
	studied word(s) that gave rise to the familiarity (nosebleed, skydive)
	and thereby reject the lure. This method of instantiating retrieval
	success under conditions in which the target word had not been studied
	offers converging evidence for the claim that anterior-prefrontal
	cortex (among other regions) demonstrates enhanced activation during
	retrieval success.},

	learning in rodents, and in memory for events in rodents, primates
	and humans. A unifying property of both navigation and event memory
	is a requirement for dealing with temporally sequenced information.
	Reactivation of temporally sequenced memories for previous behavioural
	experiences has been reported in sleep in rats. Here we report that
	sequential replay occurs in the rat hippocampus during awake periods
	immediately after spatial experience. This replay has a unique form,
	in which recent episodes of spatial experience are replayed in a
	temporally reversed order. This replay is suggestive of a role in
	the evaluation of event sequences in the manner of reinforcement
	learning models. We propose that such replay might constitute a general
	mechanism of learning and memory.},

	of 12 healthy volunteers, we tested the hypothesis that one role
	of the right prefrontal cortex is to monitor the information retrieved

	critical comparison was between two word recognition tasks that differed
	only in whether correct responses did or did not require reference
	to the spatiotemporal context of words presented during a previous
	study episode. Activation in a dorsal midlateral region of the right
	prefrontal cortex was associated with increased contextual monitoring
	demands, whereas a more ventral region of the right prefrontal cortex
	showed retrieval-related activation that was independent of task
	instructions. This functional dissociation of dorsal and ventral
	right prefrontal regions is discussed in relation to a theoretical
	framework for the control of episodic memory retrieval.},

	Abstract = {In the vast majority of brain areas, the firing rates of neurons,
	averaged over several hundred milliseconds to several seconds, can
	be strongly modulated by, and provide accurate information about,
	properties of their inputs. This is referred to as the rate code.
	However, the biophysical laws of synaptic plasticity require precise
	timing of spikes over short timescales (<10 ms). Hence it is critical
	to understand the physiological mechanisms that can generate precise
	spike timing in vivo, and the relationship between such a temporal
	code and a rate code. Here we propose a mechanism by which a temporal
	code can be generated through an interaction between an asymmetric
	rate code and oscillatory inhibition. Consistent with the predictions
	of our model, the rate and temporal codes of hippocampal pyramidal
	neurons are highly correlated. Furthermore, the temporal code becomes
	more robust with experience. The resulting spike timing satisfies
	the temporal order constraints of hebbian learning. Thus, oscillations
	and receptive field asymmetry may have a critical role in temporal
	sequence learning.},

	Abstract = {A number of neuroimaging findings have been interpreted as evidence
	that the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) subserves retrieval of
	semantic knowledge. We provide a fundamentally different interpretation,
	that it is not retrieval of semantic knowledge per se that is associated
	with left IFG activity but rather selection of information among
	competing alternatives from semantic memory. Selection demands were
	varied across three semantic tasks in a single group of subjects.
	Functional magnetic resonance imaging signal in overlapping regions
	of left IFG was dependent on selection demands in all three tasks.
	In addition, the degree of semantic processing was varied independently
	of selection demands in one of the tasks. The absence of left IFG
	activity for this comparison counters the argument that the effects
	of selection can be attributed solely to variations in degree of
	semantic retrieval. Our findings suggest that it is selection, not
	retrieval, of semantic knowledge that drives activity in the left
	IFG.},

	Annote = {OBJECTIVES: To validate a sensitive and specific screening test for
	AD and other dementias, assess its reliability and discriminative
	validity, and present normative data for its use in various applied
	settings. BACKGROUND: To improve discrimination in screening for
	AD and dementia, we developed the Memory Impairment Screen (MIS),
	a 4-minute, four-item, delayed free- and cued-recall test of memory
	impairment. The MIS uses controlled learning to ensure attention,
	induce specific semantic processing, and optimize encoding specificity
	to improve detection of dementia. METHODS: Equivalent forms of the
	MIS were given at the beginning and end of the testing session to
	assess alternate forms reliability. Discriminative validity was assessed
	in a criterion sample of 483 aged individuals, 50 of whom had dementia
	according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
	(3rd ed., revised) criteria. RESULTS: The MIS had good alternate
	forms reliability, high construct validity for memory impairment,
	and good discriminative validity in terms of sensitivity, specificity,
	and positive predictive value. We present normative data for use
	in settings with different base rates (prevalences) of AD and dementia.
	CONCLUSION: The MIS provides efficient, reliable, and valid screening
	for AD and other dementias.},

@article{RosbEtal09,
	Abstract = {For patients with schizophrenia, a deficient gating (or filtering)
	of sensory input has been described. One major approach to study
	this sensory gating is to measure event-related potentials (ERPs)
	in response to paired clicks. In these experiments, sensory gating
	is quantified as amplitude reduction of the ERP components P50 and
	N100 from the 1st to the 2nd stimulus. In ERP studies brain electrical
	signals are averaged over single trials. Alterations in phase locking
	might be one factor contributing to the observed deficits in sensory
	gating, but findings have been inconclusive as yet. In particular,
	the contribution of different frequency bands to the deficit required
	further investigation. We studied N100 gating by intracranial recordings
	in a sample of epilepsy patients and subdivided the group into good
	and poor gators of the intracranial ERP component N100. Data were
	evaluated by frequency specific wavelet-based phase and power analyses.
	Poor N100 gators had an increased phase locking in the frequency
	range from 6.0-15.1 Hz after the 2nd stimulus, as compared to good
	gators. Other group differences were apparent already before the
	2nd stimulus. Poor gators had less phase locked beta band activity
	(20.2-30.0 Hz) than good gators 200-315 ms after the onset of the
	1st stimulus. Within the group of poor gators, lower values of phase
	locking in this frequency range were also associated with lower gating
	ratios. The reduced beta band response in response to the 1st stimulus
	may reflect poorer memory encoding of the 1st stimulus in poor gators.
	This in turn might lead to increased demands to process the 2nd stimulus.},

	Abstract = {The neural substrates of recognition memory retrieval were examined
	in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study designed to separate
	activity related to recollection from that related to continuous
	variations in familiarity. Across a variety of brain regions, the
	neural signature of recollection was found to be distinct from familiarity,
	demonstrating that recollection cannot be attributed to familiarity
	strength. In the prefrontal cortex, an anterior medial region was
	related to recollection, but lateral regions, including the anterior
	and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, were related to familiarity.
	Along the lateral parietal cortex, two functionally distinct regions
	were also observed: a lateral parietal/temporal region related to
	recollection and a more superior parietal region involved in familiarity.
	Similarly, in medial parietal regions, the posterior cingulate was
	related to recollection, whereas the precuneus was related to familiarity.
	The hippocampus was related to recollection, but also exhibited an
	inverse relationship to familiarity-driven recognition confidence.
	The results indicate that recollection and familiarity rely on different
	networks of brain regions and provide insights into the functional
	roles of different regions involved in episodic recognition memory.},

	Abstract = {Although memory has been widely studied using event-related potentials,
	memory-related changes in the electroencephalogram (EEG) have been
	relatively neglected. The aim of this study was to determine whether
	evidence could be found for memory-related changes in the EEG. EEG
	was recorded from a sample of healthy volunteers while they performed
	word and face recognition memory tasks. Data were analyzed using
	the method of event-related desynchronization. In the theta frequency
	range there was a short-duration increase in power that occurred
	in the first 250 ms that was maximal at temporal sites (T5/T6). For
	words, but not faces, there was a repetition effect in theta such
	that new words elicited greater synchronization than old words at
	the midline frontal electrode (Fz). In the alpha frequency range
	there was a lateralized repetition effect, which occurred from 750
	ms. In upper alpha this effect was lateralized in the expected way
	with greater desynchronization at temporo-parietal sites on the left
	for words and on the right for faces. For lower alpha, the lateralization
	was reversed. The meanings of these findings are interpreted in the
	light of existing models of recognition memory.},

@incollection{PetzHaub04,
	Abstract = {{Numerous studies in psychophysical judgment have shown that the response
	depends not only on the current stimulus but also on previous stimulus-response
	events. In general, current responses are negatively correlated with
	the preceding stimuli and positively correlated with the preceding
	responses (e.g., Jesteadt, Luce, & Green, 1977; Petzold, 1981; Schifferstein
	& Frijters, 1992). In other words, there is assimilation toward the
	preceding responses and contrast with the preceding stimuli. These
	sequential effects can be explained by a process in which the response
	is adjusted to be consistent with the stimulus-response pair of the
	preceding trial. According to this view, the previous stimulus-response
	pair forms a frame of reference with which the current stimulus is
	compared. This implies that a relation between the internal representation
	X(t) of the current stimulus and the trace X*(t-1) of the preceding
	stimulus determines a relation between the current response r(t)
	and the preceding response r(t-1). On the other hand, there is an
	adjustment of the judgments to the total series of stimuli. The influence
	of the range suggests that stimuli are judged in relation to the
	subjective range that is defined by the lower extreme and the upper
	extreme of the stimuli presented (Parducci, 1965; Petzold, 1982;
	Witte, 1975). The essential operation then is to compare the representation
	of the stimulus with one or both of these extremes. Thus two groups
	of experimental findings lead to different assumptions on the judgment
	process. Whereas sequential effects suggest that preceding stimuli
	serve as internal standards, the influence of the range suggests
	that it is the extremes that are used as standards. Bringing sequential
	effects and range effects together, some models assume two types
	of frames of reference: (a) a trial-to-trial varying short-term system
	in which the preceding stimulus- response pair operates as referent
	and (b) a comparatively stable long-term system based on the stimulus
	set as a whole. A combination of these two systems is supposed to
	determine the judgments. The models suggested differ in their assumptions
	about the structure of short-term and long-term frames and the interplay
	between the two frames of reference. In the first part of this chapter,
	we review some recent models of the combination of short-term and
	long-term frames of reference. In the later sections, these models
	are evaluated in the light of experimental findings on sequential
	dependencies. In particular, the inverted-V pattern for correlations
	between successive responses and interactions between events one
	and two trials back are analyzed.}},

	Abstract = {Three experiments investigated the effects of spatial and temporal
	contiguity in item recognition, location judgment, and distance estimation
	tasks. Ss learned the locations of object names in spatial arrays,
	which were divided into 2 regions. The names of locations were presented
	during map learning so that critical pairs appeared close in space
	and close in time, close in space but far in time, far in space but
	close in time, and far in space and far in time. Names primed each
	other in recognition only when they were neighbors in both space
	and time. In contrast, the effects of spatial and temporal contiguity
	in priming in location judgments were additive. Finally, temporal
	contiguity affected estimates of Euclidean distance when locations
	were close together, but not when they were far apart.},

	Abstract = {The ability of written and spoken words to access the same semantic meaning provides a test case for the multimodal convergence of information from sensory to associative areas. Using anatomically constrained magnetoencephalography (aMEG), the present study investigated the stages of word comprehension in real time in the auditory and visual modalities, as subjects participated in a semantic judgment task. Activity spread from the primary sensory areas along the respective ventral processing streams and converged in anterior temporal and inferior prefrontal regions, primarily on the left at around 400 ms. Comparison of response patterns during repetition priming between the two modalities suggest that they are initiated by modality-specific memory systems, but that they are eventually elaborated mainly in supramodal areas.},

	Abstract = {Noise can degrade memories by causing transitions from one memory
	state to another. For any biological memory system to be useful,
	the time scale of such noise-induced transitions must be much longer
	than the required duration for memory retention. Using biophysically-realistic
	modeling, we consider two types of memory in the brain: short-term
	memories maintained by reverberating neuronal activity for a few
	seconds, and long-term memories maintained by a molecular switch
	for years. Both systems require persistence of (neuronal or molecular)
	activity self-sustained by an autocatalytic process and, we argue,
	that both have limited memory lifetimes because of significant fluctuations.
	We will first discuss a strongly recurrent cortical network model
	endowed with feedback loops, for short-term memory. Fluctuations
	are due to highly irregular spike firing, a salient characteristic
	of cortical neurons. Then, we will analyze a model for long-term
	memory, based on an autophosphorylation mechanism of calcium/calmodulin-dependent
	protein kinase II (CaMKII) molecules. There, fluctuations arise from
	the fact that there are only a small number of CaMKII molecules at
	each postsynaptic density (putative synaptic memory unit). Our results
	are twofold. First, we demonstrate analytically and computationally
	the exponential dependence of stability on the number of neurons
	in a self-excitatory network, and on the number of CaMKII proteins
	in a molecular switch. Second, for each of the two systems, we implement
	graded memory consisting of a group of bistable switches. For the
	neuronal network we report interesting ramping temporal dynamics
	as a result of sequentially switching an increasing number of discrete,
	bistable, units. The general observation of an exponential increase
	in memory stability with the system size leads to a trade-off between
	the robustness of memories (which increases with the size of each
	bistable unit) and the total amount of information storage (which
	decreases with increasing unit size), which may be optimized in the
	brain through biological evolution.},

	C, Trittschuh EH, Monti JM, Mesulam MM, Egner T. 2008. Neural repetition
	suppression reflects fulfilled perceptual expectations. Nat Neurosci.
	11:1004-1006.) showed that adaptation or repetition suppression is
	affected by contextual factors related to perceptual expectations,
	suggesting that adaptation results from a fulfillment of perceptual
	expectation or a reduction in prediction error. This view contrasts
	with the bottom-up fatigue or sharpening mechanisms of adaptation
	proposed in single-cell studies. We examined whether stimulus repetition
	probability affects adaptation of spiking activity and local field
	potentials (LFPs) in macaque inferior temporal (IT) cortex, using
	a protocol similar to that of Summerfield et al. Monkeys were exposed
	to 2 randomly interleaved trials, each consisting of either 2 identical
	(rep trial) or 2 different stimuli (alt trial). Trials were presented
	in repetition (rep) blocks consisting of 75% of rep trials and 25%
	of alt trials or in alternation (alt) blocks having opposite repetition
	probabilities. For both spiking and LFP activities, the stimulus-selective
	adaptation did not differ significantly between rep and alt blocks.
	The number of preceding rep or alt trials and the trial position
	within a block did not affect adaptation. This absence of any effect
	of stimulus repetition probability on adaptation suggests that adaptation
	in IT is not caused by contextual factors related to perceptual expectation.},

	Annote = {Considerable interest has been raised by non-phase-locked episodes
	of synchronization in the gamma-band (30-60 Hz). One of their putative
	roles in the visual modality is feature-binding. We tested the stimulus
	specificity of high-frequency oscillations in humans using three
	types of visual stimuli: two coherent stimuli (a Kanizsa and a real
	triangle) and a noncoherent stimulus (no-triangle stimulus). The
	task of the subject was to count the occurrences of a curved illusory
	triangle. A time-frequency analysis of single-trial EEG data recorded
	from eight human subjects was performed to characterize phase-locked
	as well as non-phase-locked high-frequency activities. We found in
	early phase-locked 40 Hz component, maximal at electrodes Cz-C4,
	which does not vary with stimulation type. We describe a second 40
	Hz component, appearing around 280 msec, that is not phase-locked
	to stimulus onset. This component is stronger in response to a coherent
	triangle, whether real or illusory: it could reflect, therefore,
	a mechanism of feature binding based on high-frequency synchronization.
	Because both the illusory and the real triangle are more target-like,
	it could also correspond to an oscillatory mechanism for testing
	the match between stimulus and target. At the same latencies, the
	low-frequency evoked response components phase-locked to stimulus
	onset behave differently, suggesting that low- and high-frequency
	activities have different functional roles.},

	of the awake primate can be dissociated by using grating and plaid
	pattern stimuli, which differentially engage surround suppression
	and cross-orientation inhibition/facilitation within and between
	cortical columns. Grating presentation yielded substantial V1 LFP
	gamma frequency oscillations and significant multi-unit activity.
	Plaid pattern presentation significantly reduced the LFP gamma power
	while increasing population multi-unit activity. The fMRI BOLD activity
	followed the LFP gamma power changes, not the multi-unit activity.
	Inference of neuronal activity from the fMRI BOLD signal thus requires
	detailed a priori knowledge of how different stimuli or tasks activate
	the cortical network.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Subjective duration is strongly influenced by repetition and novelty, such that an oddball stimulus in a stream of repeated stimuli appears to last longer in duration in comparison. We hypothesize that this duration illusion, called the temporal oddball effect, is a result of the difference in expectation between the oddball and the repeated stimuli. Specifically, we conjecture that the repeated stimuli contract in duration as a result of increased predictability; these duration contractions, we suggest, result from decreased neural response amplitude with repetition, known as repetition suppression.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Participants viewed trials consisting of lines presented at a particular orientation (standard stimuli) followed by a line presented at a different orientation (oddball stimulus). We found that the size of the oddball effect correlates with the number of repetitions of the standard stimulus as well as the amount of deviance from the oddball stimulus; both of these results are consistent with a repetition suppression hypothesis. Further, we find that the temporal oddball effect is sensitive to experimental context--that is, the size of the oddball effect for a particular experimental trial is influenced by the range of duration distortions seen in preceding trials.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data suggest that the repetition-related duration contractions causing the oddball effect are a result of neural repetition suppression. More generally, subjective duration may reflect the prediction error associated with a stimulus and, consequently, the efficiency of encoding that stimulus. Additionally, we emphasize that experimental context effects need to be taken into consideration when designing duration-related tasks.},

	Annote = {In a visual delayed matching-to-sample task, compared to a control
	condition, we had previously identified different components of the
	human EEG that could reflect the rehearsal of an object representation
	in short-term memory (Tallon-Baudry et al., 1998). These components
	were induced oscillatory activities in the gamma (24-60 Hz) and beta
	(15-20 Hz) bands, peaking during the delay at occipital and frontal
	electrodes, and two negativities in the evoked potentials. Sustained
	activities (lasting until the end of the delay) are more likely to
	reflect the continuous rehearsing process in memory than transient
	(ending before the end of the delay) activities. Nevertheless, since
	the delay vv duration we used in our previous experiment was fixed
	and rather short, it was difficult to discriminate between sustained
	and transient components. Here we used the same delayed matching-to-sample
	task, but with variable delay durations. The same oscillatory components
	in the gamma and beta bands were observed again during the delay.
	The only components that showed a sustained time course compatible
	with a memory rehearsing process were the occipital gamma and frontal
	beta induced activities. These two activities slowly decreased with
	increasing delay duration, while the performance of the subjects
	decreased in parallel. No sustained response could be found in the
	evoked potentials. These results support the hypothesis that objects
	representations in visual short-term memory consist of oscillating
	synchronized cell assemblies.},

	Abstract = {Cortical neurons receive synaptic inputs from thousands of afferents
	that fire action potentials at rates ranging from less than 1 hertz
	to more than 200 hertz. Both the number of afferents and their large
	dynamic range can mask changes in the spatial and temporal pattern
	of synaptic activity, limiting the ability of a cortical neuron to
	respond to its inputs. Modeling work based on experimental measurements
	indicates that short-term depression of intracortical synapses provides
	a dynamic gain-control mechanism that allows equal percentage rate
	changes on rapidly and slowly firing afferents to produce equal postsynaptic
	responses. Unlike inhibitory and adaptive mechanisms that reduce
	responsiveness to all inputs, synaptic depression is input-specific,
	leading to a dramatic increase in the sensitivity of a neuron to
	subtle changes in the firing patterns of its afferents.},

	Abstract = {The introduction of functional brain imaging based on BOLD-fMRI, twenty
	years ago, has revolutionized the field of human brain research.
	However, right from its inception it became clear that the BOLD signal
	suffers from a serious limitation--it reflects the averaged activity
	of large neuronal populations and hence can not, on its own, index
	the functional properties of individual neurons. The method of fMR-adaptation
	(also termed repetition suppression) was developed to circumvent
	this problem and use the BOLD signal to assess functional specializations
	at the individual neuron level. The approach is based on the tendency
	of cortical neurons to reduce their activity upon stimulus repetition.
	By examining the sensitivity of the adaptation effect to stimulus
	manipulation, insight can be gained about the invariant and selective
	properties of neuronal networks. It has been argued that the adaptation
	effect occurs at the level of synaptic inputs--and hence may be mislocalized.
	However, it is critical to consider the adaptation effect in the
	context of the cortical network architecture. This cortical anatomical
	organization, dominated by short range intrinsic connections, ensures
	that the fMR-adaptation largely reflects the response profile of
	the neurons located within the imaged voxel proper.},

@article{DuzeEtal99,
	Abstract = {In all cognitive tasks, general task-related processes operate throughout
	a given task on all items, whereas specific item-related processes
	operate differentially on individual items. In typical functional
	neuroimaging experiments, these two sets of processes have usually
	been confounded. Herein we report a combined positron emission tomography
	and event-related potential (ERP) experiment that was designed to
	distinguish between neural correlates of task-related and item-related
	processes of memory retrieval. Two retrieval tasks, episodic and
	semantic, were crossed with episodic (old/new) and semantic (living/nonliving)
	properties of individual items to yield evidence of regional brain
	activity associated with task-related processes, item-related processes,
	and their interaction. The results showed that episodic retrieval
	task was associated with increased blood flow in right prefrontal
	and posterior cingulate cortex, as well as with a sustained right-frontopolar-positive
	ERP, but that the semantic retrieval task was associated with left
	frontal and temporal lobe activity. Retrieval of old items was associated
	with increased blood flow in the left medial temporal lobe and with
	a brief late positive ERP component. The results provide converging
	hemodynamic and electrophysiological evidence for the distinction
	of task- and item-related processes, show that they map onto spatially
	and temporally distinct patterns of brain activity, and clarify the
	hemispheric encoding/retrieval asymmetry (HERA) model of prefrontal
	encoding and retrieval asymmetry.},

	Abstract = {When the same visual stimulus is repeatedly presented with a brief
	interval, the brain responses to that stimulus are attenuated relative
	to those at first presentation [neural adaptation (NA)]. Although
	this effect has been widely observed in various regions of human
	brain, its temporal dynamics as a neuronal population has been mostly
	unclear. In the present study, we used a magnetoencephalography (MEG)
	and conducted a macrolevel investigation of the temporal profiles
	of the NA occurring in the human visual ventral stream. The combination
	of MEG with our previous random dot blinking method isolated the
	neural responses in the higher visual cortex relating to shape perception.
	We dissociated three dimensions of the NA: activation strength, peak
	latency, and temporal duration of neural response. The results revealed
	that visual responses to the repeated compared with novel stimulus
	showed a significant reduction in both activation strength and peak
	latency but not in the duration of neural processing. Furthermore,
	this acceleration of peak latency showed a significant correlation
	with reaction time of the subjects, whereas no correlation was found
	between the reaction time and the temporal duration of neural responses.
	These results indicate that (1) the NA involves the brain response
	changes in the temporal domain as well as the response attenuation
	reported previously, and (2) this temporal change is primarily observed
	as a rapid rising of "what" responses, rather than a temporal shortening
	of neural response curves within the visual ventral stream as considered
	previously.},

	Annote = {$\blacksquare$ The authors examined the factors that contribute to
	burst activity (fast series of action potentials) in the hippocampal
	pyramidal cell of behaving animals. They found that two conditions
	are prerequisite for bursts: a sufficient level of excitation coupled
	with a preceeding silence of the neuron (non-spiking). They found
	that the proportion of bursts was largest not in place cell centers,
	but in places where discharge frequency was 6-7 Hz. Given that this
	balance point (frequency of highest burst probability) occurs for
	firing rates equal to the theta rhythm frequency, the authors suggest
	that theta-modulated inhibition may provide the de-inactivation necessary
	for complex bursting. As spike bursts at theta frequency have been
	found to be effective in inducing LTP, this cellular mechanism might
	facilitate LTP induction in hippocampal pyramidal cells.},

	Abstract = {People often fail to recall the second of two visual targets presented
	within 500 ms in rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP). This effect
	is called the attentional blink. One explanation of the attentional
	blink is that processes involved in encoding the first target into
	memory are slow and capacity limited. Here, however, we show that
	the attentional blink should be ascribed to attentional selection,
	not consolidation of the first target. Rapid sequences of six letters
	were presented, and observers had to report either all the letters
	(whole-report condition) or a subset of the letters (partial-report
	condition). Selection in partial report was based on color (e.g.,
	report the two red letters) or identity (i.e., report all letters
	from a particular letter onward). In both cases, recall of letters
	presented shortly after the first selected letter was impaired, whereas
	recall of the corresponding letters was relatively accurate with
	whole report.},

@article{MagrEtal12,
	Abstract = {There is growing evidence that several components of the mass neural
	activity contributing to the local field potential (LFP) can be partly
	separated by decomposing the LFP into nonoverlapping frequency bands.
	Although the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal has been
	found to correlate preferentially with specific frequency bands of
	the LFP, it is still unclear whether the BOLD signal relates to the
	activity expressed by each LFP band independently of the others or
	if, instead, it also reflects specific relationships among different
	bands. We investigated these issues by recording, simultaneously
	and with high spatiotemporal resolution, BOLD signal and LFP during
	spontaneous activity in early visual cortices of anesthetized monkeys
	(Macaca mulatta). We used information theory to characterize the
	statistical dependency between BOLD and LFP. We found that the alpha
	(8-12 Hz), beta (18-30 Hz), and gamma (40-100 Hz) LFP bands were
	informative about the BOLD signal. In agreement with previous studies,
	gamma was the most informative band. Both increases and decreases
	in BOLD signal reliably followed increases and decreases in gamma
	power. However, both alpha and beta power signals carried information
	about BOLD that was largely complementary to that carried by gamma
	power. In particular, the relationship between alpha and gamma power
	was reflected in the amplitude of the BOLD signal, while the relationship
	between beta and gamma bands was reflected in the latency of BOLD
	with respect to significant changes in gamma power. These results
	lay the basis for identifying contributions of different neural pathways
	to cortical processing using fMRI.},

	Abstract = {Neurophysiological studies have identified a number of brain regions
	critically involved in solving the problem of action selection or
	decision making. In the case of highly practiced tasks, these regions
	include cortical areas hypothesized to integrate evidence supporting
	alternative actions and the basal ganglia, hypothesized to act as
	a central switch in gating behavioral requests. However, despite
	our relatively detailed knowledge of basal ganglia biology and its
	connectivity with the cortex and numerical simulation studies demonstrating
	selective function, no formal theoretical framework exists that supplies
	an algorithmic description of these circuits. This article shows
	how many aspects of the anatomy and physiology of the circuit involving
	the cortex and basal ganglia are exactly those required to implement
	the computation defined by an asymptotically optimal statistical
	test for decision making: the multihypothesis sequential probability
	ratio test (MSPRT). The resulting model of basal ganglia provides
	a new framework for understanding the computation in the basal ganglia
	during decision making in highly practiced tasks. The predictions
	of the theory concerning the properties of particular neuronal populations
	are validated in existing experimental data. Further, we show that
	this neurobiologically grounded implementation of MSPRT outperforms
	other candidates for neural decision making, that it is structurally
	and parametrically robust, and that it can accommodate cortical mechanisms
	for decision making in a way that complements those in basal ganglia.},

	Abstract = {A formal dual-process model that assumes that memory judgments can
	be based on a threshold recollection process and a signal-detection-based
	familiarity process is proposed to account for both recognition and
	source-memory performance. The model was tested in 4 experiments
	by examining recognition and source-memory receiver operating characteristics
	(ROCs). In agreement with the predictions of the model, recognition
	and source memory dissociated in certain conditions. Recognition
	ROCs were curvilinear in probability space and relatively linear
	in z-space, as expected if recollection and familiarity contributed
	to performance. In contrast, source ROCs typically were linear and
	exhibited a pronounced U shape in z-space, as expected if performance
	primarily relied on recollection. However, in conditions in which
	familiarity was clearly indicative of an item's source, the source
	ROC became curvilinear, suggesting that participants could use familiarity
	as a basis for source judgments. Several alternative models, including
	the unequal-variance signal-detection model, were found to be inconsistent
	with the ROC data.},

	Four levels of lag were used within a single session, from zero to
	one, to tens of intervening stimuli, and which allowed partial separation
	of the effects of interference from the effects of time. Reaction
	times (RTs) showed that the magnitude of repetition priming decreased
	as lag increased. The ERP data showed two distinct effects of repetition,
	one between 150 and 300 ms post stimulus and another between 400
	and 600 ms. The magnitude of both effects, particularly the earlier
	one, decreased as lag increased. The fMRI data showed a decrease
	in the haemodynamic response associated with repetition in several
	inferior occipitotemporal regions, the magnitude of which also typically
	decreased as lag increased. In general, and contrary to expectations,
	lag appeared to have mainly quantitative effects on the three types

@article{StarRatc10,
	Annote = {used difusion model to examine age differences speed/accuracy trade offs in two alternative choice tasks. Much work has shown that older adults tend to respond more slowly than younger adults, perhaps to avoid making errors. That is, there is evidence that older adults are more conservative thay younger adults, willing to take longer to make a decision if it improves accuract even a little. 

In a difusion model, conservitivism can be represented by boundary seperation. The upper boundary represents the amoung of evidece that must accumulate for option A before a response is made, the lower boundary is for option B. If the two boundaries are close, a choice is made after only a little evidence has accumulated (i.e., a little dirft in either direction trigers a response) but at the cost of accuracy as random drift could result in corssing the incorrect boundary. When boundaries are widely seperated responding is highy accurate as random dirft is unlikely to push far enough in the wrong direction. But responding is slow as much evidence must accumulate before a boundary is reached.

They reanalysed several old discrimination experiments (e.g. brightness iscrimination, letter discrimination,recognition memory) fitting difusion models to older and younger adult data. The older adult consistently had wider decision boundaries, which consistently overshot optimal boundary seperation (as defined by the boundary that would give the highest rate of correct responses per unit time - i.e., responding more quickly that optimal would lead to more errors and thus fewer correct responses per unti time, and responding more slowly would decrease the number of total responses per unit time considerably but would not increase the number of correct responses much). That is, older adults used boundaries that sacrificed speed for accuracy. 

Found that when feedback about response accuracy was given, younger but not older adults adjusted their boundaries to be closer to optimal. Similarly, younger adults adjusted their boundaries toward optimal if given considerable practice with the task, but older adults did not. However, instructions that emphasized speed, did reduce the age difference in boundary seperation. 

Intrestingly, older adults mainatined nearly asympotic accuracy (i.e., the highest possible accuracy a difusion model with a given set of parameters but varying boundary seperation could acheive), even though narrowing the bounday a little would reduce accuracy only a little while increasing speed considerably.

Overall suggests that older adults are slower not because they cannot go faster, but because the put a high preimum on accuracy, and a low preimum on speed (though the authors argue that it is not simply a case of older adults weighting accuracy more hightly than youngers in the responses/unit time equation, as if that was the only difference older adults should be sensitive to practice and feedback).

Very cool, but depends on assuming the boundary parameter of the difusion model actually corresponds to the psychological process, and the legimaticy of correct responses per unit time as a definition of optimality (they speak to the latter a little in the discussion).},

@article{MullKubi87,
	Annote = {Using the techniques set out in the preceding paper (Muller et al.,
	1987), we investigated the response of place cells to changes in
	the animal's environment. The standard apparatus used was a cylinder,
	76 cm in diameter, with walls 51 cm high. The interior was uniformly
	gray except for a white cue card that ran the full height of the
	wall and occupied 100 degrees of arc. The floor of the apparatus
	presented no obstacles to the animal's motions. Each of these major
	features of the apparatus was varied while the others were held constant.
	One set of manipulations involved the cue card. Rotating the cue
	card produced equal rotations of the firing fields of single cells.
	Changing the width of the card did not affect the size, shape, or
	radial position of firing fields, although sometimes the field rotated
	to a modest extent. Removing the cue card altogether also left the
	size, shape, and radial positions of firing fields unchanged, but
	caused fields to rotate to unpredictable angular positions. The second
	set of manipulations dealt with the size and shape of the apparatus
	wall. When the standard (small) cylinder was scaled up in diameter
	and height by a factor of 2, the firing fields of 36\% of the cells
	observed in both cylinders also scaled, in the sense that the field
	stayed at the same angular position and at the same relative radial
	position. Of the cells recorded in both cylinders, 52\% showed very
	different firing patterns in one cylinder than in the other. The
	remaining 12\% of the cells were virtually silent in both cylinders.
	Similar results were obtained when individual cells were recorded
	in both a small and a large rectangular enclosure. By contrast, when
	the apparatus floor plan was changed from circular to rectangular,
	the firing pattern of a cell in an apparatus of one shape could not
	be predicted from a knowledge of the firing pattern in the other
	shape. The final manipulations involved placing vertical barriers
	into the otherwise unobstructed floor of the small cylinder. When
	an opaque barrier was set up to bisect a previously recorded firing
	field, in almost all cases the firing field was nearly abolished.
	This was true even though the barrier occupied only a small fraction
	of the firing field area. A transparent barrier was effective as
	the opaque barrier in attenuating firing fields. The lead base used
	to anchor the vertical barriers did not affect place cell firing.},

@article{QuirEtal90,
	Annote = {Hippocampal place cells fire when a freely moving rat is in a given
	location. The firing of these cells is controlled by visual and nonvisual
	environmental cues. The effects of darkness on the firing of place
	cells was studied using the task of Muller et al. (1987), in which
	rats were trained to chase randomly scattered food pellets in a cylindrical
	drum with a white cue-card attached to the wall. The position of
	the rats was tracked via an infrared LED on the headstage with a
	video system linked to computer. Two experimental protocols were
	used: in the first, lights were turned off after the rat had already
	been placed in the chamber; in the second, the rat was placed in
	the darkened chamber. The dark segments produced by these 2 methods
	were identical with respect to light and other cues but differed
	with respect to the rat's experience. The firing patterns of 24 of
	28 cells were unaffected by darkness when it was preceded by a light
	period. In contrast, the firing patterns of 14 of 22 cells changed
	dramatically when the rats were put into the darkened chamber. Furthermore,
	the majority of cells that changed their firing pattern in initial
	darkness maintained that change when the lights were turned on. These
	results show that place cells can fire differently in identical cue
	situations and that the best predictor of firing pattern is a combination
	of current cues and the rat's recent experience. The results are
	discussed in terms of mnemonic properties of hippocampal cells and
	remapping of place cell representations.},

Perhaps most critically, the domain general WM component was a good predictor of fluid intelegence. However, the domain general simple span components were not so good with gf, but did correlate with domain general reasoning.},

	Abstract = {Word properties like imageability and word frequency improve cued
	recall of verbal paired-associates. We asked whether these enhancements
	follow simply from prior effects on item-memory, or also strengthen
	associations between items. Participants studied word pairs varying
	in imageability or frequency: pairs were ``pure'' (high--high, low--low)
	or ``mixed'' (high--low, low--high) where ``high'' and ``low'' refer
	to imageability or frequency values and are probed with forward (A--?)
	and backward (?--B) cues. Probabilistic model fits to the data suggested
	that imageability primarily improved retrieval of associations, but
	frequency primarily improved recall of target items. All pair types
	exhibited a high cor- relation between forward and backward probe
	accuracy, a measure of holistic learning (Kahana, 2002), which extends
	the boundary conditions of holistic association-memory and challenges
	Paivio's (1971) suggestion that holistic learning depends critically
	on imag- ery. In sum, item properties can boost association-memory
	beyond simply boosting target retrievability.},

@article{Cowa00,
	Annote = {Talks about difference between capacity and time limits and suggest there might be a capacity limit for focus of attention (how many items in short-term memory can be attended to at once) and a time (decay) based limit on the short-term memory store it self. However, he says the time limit on short-term memory question is ``nearly intractable'' due to confounds with interference and other activities concomitant with the passage of time. 

He then moves on to discuss the true maximum number of chunks for short-term memory (however, it is not clear to me wether or not he is abandoning time based limitations or simply trying to build the case that the chunk capacity limit is a limit of attention and not short-term memory per se).

Talks about diff between pure capacity-based estimates of short-term memory and compund short-term memory estimates, where in compound estimates other structures play a role (e.g., to help create larger chunks and possibly even store infor) which are themselfs limited in other ways (e.g., interference and maybe time based decay?; he just says time based p 88, but prob means decay). Must then get pure estimate of capacity 

At least 4 ways

1.	info overload prevents info from being compounded into larger chunks (i.e., 1 chunk=1 stimulus item)
2.	recoding into larger chunks is prevented
3.	``when performance discontinuities caused by the capacity limit are examined''
4.	``when various indirect effects of the capacity limit are examined''

In theoretical section (2) says that it is attn that is capacity limited and no other mental faculties are capacity limited (but may have other types of limits)

The limited capacity plays a role in retrieval as well, because it is assumed that explicitly recalled information must be in the focus of attention just before being reported. Therefore, it is important to ensure that no internal or external aids exist that can be used to supplement the limited capacity of attentional focus during recall or a compound measure of short-term memory could result.

It is assumed that chunks formed by taking advantage of association in long-term memory can be unlimited in size (e.g., the chunks of expert chess players), however chunks formed during an experiment based solely on associations created between the presented stimuli which did not exist a priori will be limited to ~four items because all of the items must be held in the focus of attn while the chunk is being formed.

Mnemonic stratigies such as rehershal must be prevented to get a pure measure of capacity limits

Section 3

First exp described: says that elements in sensory memory activate features in long-term memory. In the experiment the array was made up of letters so it could be reasonably argued that long-term memory is involved but what if the exp were replicated using all visually similar stimuli and having the position be recalled: it seems unlikely that long-term memory activiation would occur differentially for the diff positions?? Is long-term memory necessary here? Can the info get into focus of attn through diff routes?


	Claims that ``only the information in the focus of attention is available to conscious awareness and report''
	
	suggests that distraction (e.g., dual task studies) may help decide wether capacity is attention dependany (consistent with focus of attention being the locus of limits) or not (consistent with something like an episodic buffer being consistent)

	Abstract = {Although it is widely accepted that the medial temporal lobes (MTLs)
	are critical for becoming aware that something happened in the past,
	there is virtually no evidence whether MTL sensitivity to event oldness
	also depends on conscious awareness. Using event-related functional
	magnetic resonance imaging, we show that activity in posterior MTL
	tracks whether an item is actually old (true oldness), regardless
	of participants' awareness of oldness (perceived oldness). Confirming
	its sensitivity to the objective nature of the stimulus, activity
	in this region was strongly correlated with individual memory performance
	(r = 0.74). At the same time, we found that memory errors (misses)
	were associated with activity in an anterior MTL region, which signaled
	whether an item was consciously experienced as new (perceived novelty).
	Logistic regression analyses based on individual trial activity indicated
	that the two MTL regions showed opposing relationships with behavior,
	and that memory performance was determined by their joint activity.
	Furthermore, functional connectivity analyses showed that perceived
	novelty activity in the posterior MTL inhibited true oldness activity
	in the anterior MTL. These findings indicate that participants' behavior
	reflected the combined effects of multiple MTL regions. More generally,
	our results show that parts of MTL can distinguish old from new independently
	of consciousness.},

@article{Dunc10,
	Annote = {Discuss a set of brain regions that tend to be found active during a wide variety of tasks. Such as the inferior frontal sulcus. Anterior insula and frontal operculum. Presuplementary motor area and dorsal acc

A largely overlapping set of regions has been identified with fluid intelegnce tasks in both imaging and lesion work. 

Suggest that complex behavior depends on separating the task into smaller sub components that can be more easily tackled in sequence to reach the final goal. Points out the similarity to production systems like actr. The point to stress here is that the decomposition it self, as much as the individual steps, is key. 

Suggest that the system divides time into cognitive epochs during which specific tasks are to be carried out on specific types of information. 

Suggest several aspects of such intelegent sequential behavior. First is selectivity for task relevant information. 

Talk about monkey studies where a stream of pictures is presented and he monkey must respond only to a target picture. Activity in Many Lateral prefrontal electrodes discriminated between targets and non targets, but much fewer discriminated between various non targets. Also talk about fmri studies in which changes to relevant stimuli result in larger activity changes than changes to irrelevant stimuli. 

A second feature is the ability to rapidly change what is thought to be irrelevant, or as he says to rapidly change the processing focus and content. For example in the monkey study described above, even when the target changed from trial to trial, sometimes being something that was a non target on previous trials, the electrodes still predominately discriminated target from non target but not between different non targets. 

Found that when activity levels across a large group of neurons in monkey studies were correlated within a task, the correlations were high, but when correlated across different tasks the correlations we're near zero. Suggest that subtle differences in needs within a cognitive epoch are coded by minor alterations to a broader pattern of activity, but the major differences in needs across epochs are coded by changing the broad pattern of activity. Suggest that having the pattern of activity representing different epochs be orthogonal to each other facilitates the goal of changing and maintaining processing focus and content. 

When rules are being described for a complex task, many of the md regions show Pharos activity, increasing while instruction screens are up, decreasing during the intervals between instruction screens. However the valleys between instructions tended to raise with the number of previous instructions. },

	Abstract = {Recognition of an object can be based on memory for specific details
	of a prior encounter with the object, or on a more general memory
	for the type of object previously encountered. Responding on the
	basis of general information alone can sometimes produce memory errors
	involving both distortion and forgetting, but little is known about
	the neural origins of general versus specific recognition. We extended
	the standard subsequent memory paradigm to examine whether neural
	activity at encoding predicts whether an object will subsequently
	elicit specific as compared to general memory. During event-related
	functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), participants viewed
	objects and made size judgments about them. Later, they viewed same,
	similar, and new objects, labeling each as ``same,'' ``similar,''
	or ``new.'' Specific recognition was indicated by a ``same'' response
	to a same object. By contrast, general, non-specific recognition
	was indicated by either a ``same'' response to a similar object (false
	memory) or a ``similar'' response to a same object (partial memory).
	As predicted, specific recognition, as compared to non-specific recognition,
	was associated with encoding-related activity in the right fusiform
	cortex, while non-specific recognition, as compared to forgetting,
	was associated with encoding-related activity in the left fusiform
	cortex. Furthermore, all successful recognition (specific and general),
	as compared to forgetting, was associated with encoding-related activity
	in bilateral fusiform cortex. These results suggest that the right
	fusiform cortex is associated with specific feature encoding, while
	the left fusiform cortex is involved in more general object encoding.},

	Abstract = {In this article, the authors consider optimal decision making in two-alternative
	forced-choice (TAFC) tasks. They begin by analyzing 6 models of TAFC
	decision making and show that all but one can be reduced to the drift
	diffusion model, implementing the statistically optimal algorithm
	(most accurate for a given speed or fastest for a given accuracy).
	They prove further that there is always an optimal trade-off between
	speed and accuracy that maximizes various reward functions, including
	reward rate (percentage of correct responses per unit time), as well
	as several other objective functions, including ones weighted for
	accuracy. They use these findings to address empirical data and make
	novel predictions about performance under optimality.},

	for working memory capacity, sentence comprehension, and rapid-naming

	2 weeks postoperatively. Immediate recall of stories was assessed

	A second experiment, with additional patients, explored the possible
	contribution of the hippocampus and of the frontal lobes to performance
	on these same tasks. Extent of hippocampal excision did not affect
	performance differentially on any task. Story recall was impaired
	following left temporal lobectomy, whereas left frontal lobectomy

	Abstract = {A series of experiments investigated whether people could integrate
	nonspatial information about an object with their knowledge of the
	object's location in space. In Experiments 1 and 3, subjects learned
	the locations of cities on a fictitious road map; in Experiments
	2, 4, and 5, subjects were already familiar with the locations of
	buildings on a campus. The subjects then learned facts about the
	cities on the maps or the buildings on the campus. The question of
	interest was whether or not these nonspatial facts would be integrated
	in memory with the spatial knowledge. After learning the facts, subjects
	were given a location-judgment test in which they had to decide whether
	an object was in one region of the space or another. Knowledge integration
	was assessed by comparing levels of performance in two conditions:
	(a) when a city or a building name was primed by a fact about a neighboring
	city or building, and (b) when a city or a building name was primed
	by a fact about a distant city or building. Results showed that responses
	in Condition a were faster or more accurate, or both faster and more
	accurate, than responses in Condition b. These results indicate that
	the spatial and nonspatial information were encoded in a common memory
	representation.},

@article{LiEtal93,
	Abstract = {1. The inferior temporal (IT) cortex plays an important role in both
	short- and long-term memory for visual patterns. Most previous studies
	of IT neurons have tested their responses in recency memory tasks,
	which require that the memory lasts only the length of a single behavioral
	trial, which may be < 1 s. To determine the role of IT neurons in
	longer lasting memories, we measured their responses to initially
	novel stimuli as the stimuli gradually became familiar to the animal.
	2. Two rhesus monkeys were trained on a delayed matching to sample
	(DMS) task with several intervening stimuli between the sample and
	the final matching stimulus on each trial. The purpose of the task
	was to ensure that the animal attended to the stimuli and held them
	in memory, at least temporarily. Unlike in several previous studies,
	the focus was not on within-trial effects but rather on the incidental
	memories that built up across trials as the stimuli became familiar.
	Each cell was tested with a set of 20 novel stimuli (digitized pictures
	of objects) that the monkey had not seen before. These stimuli were
	used in a fixed order over the course of an hour-long recording session,
	and the number of intervening trials between repetitions of a given
	sample stimulus was varied. 3. The responses of about one-third of
	the cells recorded in anterior-ventral IT cortex declined systematically
	as the novel stimuli became familiar. After six to eight repetitions,
	responses reached a plateau that was approximately 40% of the peak
	response. Virtually all of these cells also showed selectivity for
	particular visual stimuli and thus were not "novelty detectors" in
	the sense of cells that respond to any novel stimulus. Rather, the
	responses of these cells were a joint function of familiarity and
	specific object features such as shape and color. A few cells showed
	increasing responses with repetition over the recording session,
	but these changes were accompanied by changes in baseline firing
	rate, suggesting that they were caused by nonspecific effects. 4.
	The decrement in response with familiarity was stimulus specific
	and bridged > 150 presentations of other stimuli, the maximum tested.
	For some cells the maximum decrement in response occurred for those
	stimuli that initially elicited the largest response. There was no
	significant change in response to stimuli that were already familiar.
	5. The same cells that showed familiarity effects also showed reduced
	responses to the matching stimuli at the end of each trial, compared
	with the responses to the samples.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

@article{GabrEtal98,
	Abstract = {This article reviews attempts to characterize the mental operations
	mediated by left inferior prefrontal cortex, especially the anterior
	and inferior portion of the gyrus, with the functional neuroimaging
	techniques of positron emission tomography and functional magnetic
	resonance imaging. Activations in this region occur during semantic,
	relative to nonsemantic, tasks for the generation of words to semantic
	cues or the classification of words or pictures into semantic categories.
	This activation appears in the right prefrontal cortex of people
	known to be atypically right-hemisphere dominant for language. In
	this region, activations are associated with meaningful encoding
	that leads to superior explicit memory for stimuli and deactivations
	with implicit semantic memory (repetition priming) for words and
	pictures. New findings are reported showing that patients with global
	amnesia show deactivations in the same region associated with repetition
	priming, that activation in this region reflects selection of a response
	from among numerous relative to few alternatives, and that activations
	in a portion of this region are associated specifically with semantic
	relative to phonological processing. It is hypothesized that activations
	in left inferior prefrontal cortex reflect a domain-specific semantic
	working memory capacity that is invoked more for semantic than nonsemantic
	analyses regardless of stimulus modality, more for initial than for
	repeated semantic analysis of a word or picture, more when a response
	must be selected from among many than few legitimate alternatives,
	and that yields superior later explicit memory for experiences.},

@article{BowmWybl07,
	Abstract = {A detailed description of the simultaneous type, serial token (ST2)
	model is presented. ST2 is a model of temporal attention and working
	memory that encapsulates 5 principles: (a) M. M. Chun and M. C. Potter's
	(1995) 2-stage model, (b) a Stage 1 salience filter, (c) N. G. Kanwisher's
	(1987, 1991) types-tokens distinction, (d) a transient attentional
	enhancement, and (e) a mechanism for associating types with tokens
	called the binding pool. The authors instantiate this theoretical
	position in a connectionist implementation, called neural-ST2, which
	they illustrate by modeling temporal attention results focused on
	the attentional blink (AB). They demonstrate that the ST2 model explains
	a spectrum of AB findings. Furthermore, they highlight a number of
	new temporal attention predictions arising from the ST2 theory, which
	are tested in a series of behavioral experiments. Finally, the authors
	review major AB models and theories and compare them with ST2.},

	Annote = {A list based directed forgetting study in which List 1 was given a forgetting cue (or not) before studying list 2. used stems of the studied words as cues for a cued recall task at end of list 2. Critically, varied the number list 2 items test before testing any list 1 items. 

Found that when list 1 was directed to be forgotten, increasing the number of list 2 items tested before testing list 1 produced better list 1 memoy. Conversley, when no forgetting cue was given, more testing of list 2 lead to reduced memory for list 1. 

The two effects were so strong that while there was a typical directed forgetting effect when zero list 2 items were tested before testing list 1, the effect actually reversed when 12 list 2 items were tested first, - i.e., the two be remembered list was recalled worse than the to be forgotten list. 

Authors suggest that during retreival attempts, to-be-remembered traces are weakened (inhibited)  whereas to-be-forgotten tarces are strenghtened (receive spreading activation). Exactly how the system tells to-be-rememvered from to-be-forgotten is not clear to me.

ME: seems the data do not necessiate seperate processes for to-be-forgotten/remembered traces: I think an acumulator model with both facilatation and inhibition could account for the data if you assume to-be-forgotten traces have a lower starting activation level, and perhaps non-linearity in the amount of inhibition/facilitation applied as a function of current activation level.},

	Abstract = {We measured thresholds for comparing the separation between lines,
	using either the method of constant stimuli (MCS) or the method of
	single stimuli (MSS). In the MCS an explicit standard is presented
	on each trial, whereas in the MSS the standard is the mean of the
	set. The thresholds for the MSS procedure were nearly identical to
	those with the MCS procedure, whether or not feedback was used. A
	statistical model is presented showing how the threshold error estimated
	by MSS varies according to the number of past stimuli used by the
	observer to calculate the mean of the set. If the model is an accurate
	representation of human processing, our observers were averaging
	over the last 10-20 trials to estimate the implicit standard. Our
	results show that the explicit standard in the MCS procedure is generally
	superfluous. Provided that the test range is small, and that the
	observer is given some practice trials, thresholds measured with
	MSS procedure are just as precise as those measured with the traditional
	MCS procedure. },

	Abstract = {Cortical neurons exhibit tremendous variability in the number and
	temporal distribution of spikes in their discharge patterns. Furthermore,
	this variability appears to be conserved over large regions of the
	cerebral cortex, suggesting that it is neither reduced nor expanded
	from stage to stage within a processing pathway. To investigate the
	principles underlying such statistical homogeneity, we have analyzed
	a model of synaptic integration incorporating a highly simplified
	integrate and fire mechanism with decay. We analyzed a ``high-input
	regime'' in which neurons receive hundreds of excitatory synaptic
	inputs during each interspike interval. To produce a graded response
	in this regime, the neuron must balance excitation with inhibition.
	We find that a simple integrate and fire mechanism with balanced
	excitation and inhibition produces a highly variable interspike interval,
	consistent with experimental data. Detailed information about the
	temporal pattern of synaptic inputs cannot be recovered from the
	pattern of output spikes, and we infer that cortical neurons are
	unlikely to transmit information in the temporal pattern of spike
	discharge. Rather, we suggest that quantities are represented as
	rate codes in ensembles of 50-100 neurons. These column-like ensembles
	tolerate large fractions of common synaptic input and yet covary
	only weakly in their spike discharge. We find that an ensemble of
	100 neurons provides a reliable estimate of rate in just one interspike
	interval (10-50 msec). Finally, we derived an expression for the
	variance of the neural spike count that leads to a stable propagation
	of signal and noise in networks of neurons-that is, conditions that
	do not impose an accumulation or diminution of noise. The solution
	implies that single neurons perform simple algebra resembling averaging,
	and that more sophisticated computations arise by virtue of the anatomical
	convergence of novel combinations of inputs to the cortical column
	from external sources.},

	Abstract = {Although studies in animals and patients have demonstrated that brain
	oscillations play a role in declarative memory encoding and retrieval,
	little has been done to investigate the temporal dynamics and sources
	of brain activity in healthy human subjects performing such tasks.
	In a magnetoencephalography study using pictorial stimuli, we have
	now identified oscillatory activity in the gamma (60-90 Hz) and theta
	(4.5-8.5 Hz) band during declarative memory operations in healthy
	participants. Both theta and gamma activity was stronger for the
	later remembered compared with the later forgotten items (the ``subsequent
	memory effect''). In the retrieval session, theta and gamma activity
	was stronger for recognized items compared with correctly rejected
	new items (the ``old/new effect''). The gamma activity was also stronger
	for recognized compared with forgotten old items (the ``recognition
	effect''). The effects in the theta band were observed over right
	parietotemporal areas, whereas the sources of the effects in the
	gamma band were identified in Brodmann area 18/19. We propose that
	the theta activity is directly engaged in mnemonic operations. The
	increase in neuronal synchronization in the gamma band in occipital
	areas may result in a stronger drive to subsequent areas, thus facilitating
	both memory encoding and retrieval. Alternatively, the gamma synchronization
	might reflect representations being reinforced by top-down activity
	from higher-level memory areas. Our results provide additional insight
	on human declarative memory operations and oscillatory brain activity
	that complements previous electrophysiological and brain imaging
	studies.},

	Abstract = {Decision-making requires the coordinated activity of diverse brain
	structures. For example, in maze-based tasks, the prefrontal cortex
	must integrate spatial information encoded in the hippocampus with
	mnemonic information concerning route and task rules in order to
	direct behavior appropriately. Using simultaneous tetrode recordings
	from CA1 of the rat hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex, we
	show that correlated firing in the two structures is selectively
	enhanced during behavior that recruits spatial working memory, allowing
	the integration of hippocampal spatial information into a broader,
	decision-making network. The increased correlations are paralleled
	by enhanced coupling of the two structures in the 4- to 12-Hz theta-frequency
	range. Thus the coordination of theta rhythms may constitute a general
	mechanism through which the relative timing of disparate neural activities
	can be controlled, allowing specialized brain structures to both
	encode information independently and to interact selectively according
	to current behavioral demands.},

	Annote = {Processing language requires the retrieval of concepts from memory
	in response to an ongoing stream of information. This retrieval is
	facilitated if one can infer the gist of a sentence, conversation,
	or document and use that gist to predict related concepts and disambiguate
	words. This article analyzes the abstract computational problem underlying
	the extraction and use of gist, formulating this problem as a rational
	statistical inference. This leads to a novel approach to semantic
	representation in which word meanings are represented in terms of
	a set of probabilistic topics. The topic model performs well in predicting
	word association and the effects of semantic association and ambiguity
	on a variety of language-processing and memory tasks. It also provides
	a foundation for developing more richly structured statistical models
	of language, as the generative process assumed in the topic model
	can easily be extended to incorporate other kinds of semantic and
	syntactic structure.},

	Abstract = {Quick and efficient traversal of learned routes is critical to the
	survival of many animals. Routes can be defined by both the ordering
	of navigational epochs, such as continued forward motion or execution
	of a turn, and the distances separating them. The neural substrates
	conferring the ability to fluidly traverse complex routes are not
	well understood, but likely entail interactions between frontal,
	parietal, and rhinal cortices and the hippocampus. This paper demonstrates
	that posterior parietal cortical neurons map both individual and
	multiple navigational epochs with respect to their order in a route.
	In direct contrast to spatial firing patterns of hippocampal neurons,
	parietal neurons discharged in a place- and direction-independent
	fashion. Parietal route maps were scalable and versatile in that
	they were independent of the size and spatial configuration of navigational
	epochs. The results provide a framework in which to consider parietal
	function in spatial cognition.},

	Abstract = {We recorded from single neurons in the hippocampus and entorhinal
	cortex (EC) of rats to investigate the role of these structures in
	navigation and memory representation. Our results revealed two novel
	phenomena: first, many cells in CA1 and the EC fired at significantly
	different rates when the animal was in the same position depending
	on where the animal had come from or where it was going. Second,
	cells in deep layers of the EC, the targets of hippocampal outputs,
	appeared to represent the similarities between locations on spatially

	that the hippocampus represents the animal's position in the context

	Annote = {Working memory involves the short-term maintenance of an active representation

	working memory tasks, in which subjects retain the memory of a stimulus
	over brief delays, require both the perceptual encoding of the stimulus
	and the subsequent maintenance of its representation after the stimulus
	is removed from view. Such tasks activate multiple areas in visual
	and prefrontal cortices. To delineate the roles these areas play
	in perception and working memory maintenance, we used functional
	magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to obtain dynamic measures of neural
	activity related to different components of a face working memory
	task-non-selective transient responses to visual stimuli, selective
	transient responses to faces, and sustained responses over memory
	delays. Three occipitotemporal areas in the ventral object vision
	pathway had mostly transient responses to stimuli, indicating their
	predominant role in perceptual processing, whereas three prefrontal
	areas demonstrated sustained activity over memory delays, indicating
	their predominant role in working memory. This distinction, however,
	was not absolute. Additionally, the visual areas demonstrated different
	degrees of selectivity, and the prefrontal areas demonstrated different
	strengths of sustained activity, revealing a continuum of functional
	specialization, from occipital through multiple prefrontal areas,

	were characterized as time series of vectors of PN activity, constructed
	from the firing rates of all PNs in successive 50 ms time bins. Odor
	representations by the PN population can be described as trajectories
	in PN state space with three main phases: an on transient, lasting
	1-2 s; a fixed point, stable for at least 8 s; and an off transient,
	lasting a few seconds as activity returns to baseline. Whereas all
	three phases are odor specific, optimal stimulus separation occurred
	during the transients rather than the fixed points. In addition,
	the PNs' own target neurons respond least when their PN-population
	input stabilized at a fixed point. Steady-state measures of activity

	Abstract = {False memories (e.g., recognition of events that did not occur) are
	considered behaviorally and subjectively indistinguishable from true
	memories. We report that brain activity differs when true and false
	memories are retrieved. Strongly associated lists of words were presented
	to one or the other cerebral hemisphere at study. This led to lateralized
	brain activity for these words during a centrally presented recognition
	test, reflecting their lateralized encoding. This activity was absent
	for nonstudied but strongly associated words falsely recognized as
	studied items. These results indicate that studied words leave sensory
	signatures of study experiences that are absent for false memories.
	In addition, hemifield effects emerged, including a slower reaction
	time (RT) for false recognition of nonstudied words whose associated
	lists were presented to the left hemifield (i.e., right hemisphere).
	These false recognition responses were accompanied by frontal slow
	wave activity, which may reflect a differential ability of the two
	hemispheres with respect to semantic processing.},

@article{ConnEtal11,
	Abstract = {The relationship between blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD)
	functional MRI (fMRI) signal and the underlying neural electrical
	activity in humans is a topic of intense interest to systems neuroscience.
	This relationship has generally been assumed to be invariant regardless
	of the brain region and the cognitive task being studied. We critically
	evaluated these assumptions by comparing the BOLD-fMRI response with
	local field potential (LFP) measurements during visually cued common
	noun and verb generation in 11 humans in whom 1210 subdural electrodes
	were implanted. As expected, power in the mid-gamma band (60-120
	Hz) correlated positively (r(2) = 0.16, p < 10(-16)) and power in
	the beta band (13-30 Hz) correlated negatively (r(2) = 0.09, p <
	10(-16)) with the BOLD signal change. Beta and mid-gamma band activity
	independently explain different components of the observed BOLD signal.
	Importantly, we found that the location (i.e., lobe) of the recording
	site modulates the relationship between the electrocorticographic
	(ECoG) signal and the observed fMRI response (p < 10(-16), F(21,1830)
	= 52.7), while the type of language task does not. Across all brain
	regions, ECoG activity in the gamma and beta bands explains 22% of
	the fMRI response, but if the lobar location is considered, 28% of
	the variance can be explained. Further evaluation of this relationship
	at the level of individual gyri provides additional evidence of differences
	in the BOLD-LFP relationship by cortical locus. This spatial variability
	in the relationship between the fMRI signal and neural activity carries
	implications for modeling of the hemodynamic response function, an
	essential step for interregional fMRI comparisons.},

	Annote = {SEM study looking at relationship between span, gf, and LTM tasks.

Basically find that LTM tasks are hightly correlated with both span and gf. But don't do any meidation analyses or even discuss the possiblilty that span is just another LTM tasks. In fact continually refrer to span as WMC as if it was a genuine construct even though both the current state of his theory and the data suggest otherwise.

One instreting aspect is breaking down LTM into accuracy, latency, and intrusion scores. A variance partitioning analysis suggests that accuracy and latency are related to sapn and gf but intrusions are not (at least not uniquly). But that could simply be due to a floor effect and lack of variance.

All this is based on the SAM model of retreival, and the idea that high spans have a more constrained search set. This is basically the hasher and zacks claim that the key is being able to constrain retreival to only relevant information and that older adults and "lo span" people actually consider too much and not too little information. 

Also worth considering if individual differnces can be understood from a context maintence prespective (i.e., polyn kahana CMR model)

	Abstract = {In two experiments, viewers judged heading from displays simulating locomotion through tree-filled environments, with gaze off to the side. They marked their heading with a mouse-controlled probe at three different depths. When simulated eye or head rotation generally exceeded 0.5 deg/sec, there was reliable curvature in perceived paths toward the fixated object. This curvature, however, was slight even with rotation rates as great as 2.6 deg/sec. Best-fit paths to circular arcs had radii of 1.8 km or greater. In a third experiment, pedestrians walked with matched gaze to the side. Measured curvature in the direction of gaze corresponded to a circular radius of about 1.3 km. Thus, at minimum, vision scientists need not worry about perceived path curvature in this situation; real path curvatures are about the same. However, at present, we can make no claim that the same mechanisms necessarily govern the two results.},

	Abstract = {The extensive physiological data on hippocampal theta rhythm provide
	an opportunity to evaluate hypotheses about the role of theta rhythm
	for hippocampal network function. Computational models based on these
	hypotheses help to link behavioral data with physiological measurements
	of different variables during theta rhythm. This paper reviews work
	on network models in which theta rhythm contributes to the following
	functions: (1) separating the dynamics of encoding and retrieval,
	(2) enhancing the context-dependent retrieval of sequences, (3) buffering
	of novel information in entorhinal cortex (EC) for episodic encoding,
	and (4) timing interactions between prefrontal cortex and hippocampus
	for memory-guided action selection. Modeling shows how these functional
	mechanisms are related to physiological data from the hippocampal
	formation, including (1) the phase relationships of synaptic currents
	during theta rhythm measured by current source density analysis of
	electroencephalographic data from region CA1 and dentate gyrus, (2)
	the timing of action potentials, including the theta phase precession
	of single place cells during running on a linear track, the context-dependent
	changes in theta phase precession across trials on each day, and
	the context-dependent firing properties of hippocampal neurons in
	spatial alternation (e.g., ``splitter cells''), (3) the cholinergic
	regulation of sustained activity in entorhinal cortical neurons,
	and (4) the phasic timing of prefrontal cortical neurons relative
	to hippocampal theta rhythm.},

	Annote = {Examined what printed frequency measures. The authors present the
	results of a large free association study as well as the results
	of experiments designed to evaluate the hypothesis that common words
	have stronger connections to other words. In the normative study,
	college students were asked to free associate the first word to come
	to mind for each stimulus word. An average of 149 Ss responded to
	each stimulus. The norms indicate that common words tend to be more
	concrete but they do not appear to have more associates, stronger
	associates, or more connections among their associates. Two extralist
	cued recall experiments were conducted. The purpose of Exp 1 (with
	24 Ss) was to test the frequency-strength hypothesis in a simple
	experiment by selecting different types of words to be used as test
	cues for recently studied words. Exp 2, with 30 Ss, was undertaken
	as an extended replication of the 1st experiment using different
	items. The experiments showed that, with other attributes being equal,
	high- and low-frequency words were equally effective as test cues.
	These results suggest that frequency does not achieve its effects
	because of stronger or greater numbers of connections to other words,
	as implied in SAM. The materials for Exp 1 and 2 are appended. (PsycINFO

Find that both were indeed predictors of WM in a meidation model (though, odly, seem to report on the fit statistics and not the actual parameter estimates).

Perhaps more intrestingly, all three latent variables predicted gF. But a meidation analysis suggested that only WM had a unique effect, the other two shared most of their predictive variance with WM.

	Abstract = {Working memory (WM) representations serve as templates that guide behavior, but the neural basis of these templates remains elusive. We tested the hypothesis that WM templates are maintained by biasing activity in sensoriperceptual neurons that code for features of items being held in memory. Neural activity was recorded using event-related potentials (ERPs) as participants viewed a series of faces and responded when a face matched a target face held in WM. Our prediction was that if activity in neurons coding for the features of the target is preferentially weighted during maintenance of the target, then ERP activity evoked by a nontarget probe face should be commensurate with the visual similarity between target and probe. Visual similarity was operationalized as the degree of overlap in visual features between target and probe. A face-sensitive ERP response was modulated by target-probe similarity. Amplitude was largest for probes that were similar to the target, and decreased monotonically as a function of decreasing target-probe similarity. These results indicate that neural activity is weighted in favor of visual features that comprise an actively held memory representation. As such, our findings support the notion that WM templates rely on neural populations involved in forming percepts of memory items.},
