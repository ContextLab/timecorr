    "# Debugging Steps:\n",
    "1.\tBreakpoint: Place a breakpoint at the beginning of the sum_fact() function to observe the initialization of resultx and resulty.\n",
    "2.\tStep Through: Set breakpoints on the lines where resultx *= x and resulty *= y to see how the values change after each iteration.\n",
    "# Changes:\n",
    "1.\tInitial Values: resultx and resulty are now set to 1 instead of 0.\n",
    "2.\tAccumulation: I replaced resultx = x and resulty = y with resultx *= x and resulty *= y to accumulate the values (multiplying them through the loop).\n",
    "# Explanation:\n",
    "â€¢\tSetting the results to 1 ensures that you're multiplying the values during each iteration, rather than just setting them to x or y. This makes the calculation accumulate the values.\n",
